__Unit Overview__: In a period of almost 150 years during the 17th and 18th centuries, the British established 13 colonies along the Atlantic coast that provided a profitable trade and a home to a diverse group of people. From the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in North America to that start of a decisive war for European control of the continent, the colonies evolved. At first, they struggled for survival, but they became a society of permanent farms, plantations, towns, and cities. European settlers brought various cultures, economic plans, and ideas for governing to the Americas. In particular, with varying approaches, they all sought to dominate native inhabitants. The British took pride in their tradition of free farmers working the land. The various colonies developed regional or sectional differences based on many influences including topography, natural resources, climate, and the background of their settlers. They largely viewed the American Indian as an obstacle to colonial growth. With their emphasis on agriculture came a demand for labor, and this led to a growing dependence on slavery and  Atlantic slave trade to power the economy. The start of the Seven Years’ War signified the maturity of the British colonies and the influence of European conflicts in the power struggle for control in North America.

**Essential Question**: How did the meeting and interaction of cultures create a new world in America?

**Key Concept 1**: 
On a North American continent controlled by American Indians, contact among the peoples of Europe, the Americas, and West Africa created a new world.
- 1.1 Before the arrival of Europeans, native populations in North America developed a   
 wide variety of social, political, and economic structures based in part on interactions with the environment and each other.
- 1.2   European overseas expansion resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a series of interactions and adaptations among societies across the Atlantic.
- 1.3   Contacts among American Indians, Africans, and Europeans challenged the world views of each group.
		
**Key Concept 2**: 
Europeans and American Indians maneuvered and fought for dominance, control, and security in North America, and distinctive colonial and native societies emerged.
- 2.1   Differences in imperial goals, cultures, and the North American environments that 
        different empires confronted led Europeans to develop diverse patterns of   
        colonization.
- 2.2   European colonization efforts in North America stimulated intercultural contact and 
        intensified conflict between the various groups of colonizers and native peoples.
- 2.3   The increasing political, economic, and cultural exchanges within the “Atlantic 
        World” had a profound impact on the development of colonial societies in North 
        America.

# 7: How did family roles, immigrants, and changing religious values affect the emergence of a new American identity? How did they remain English?

- American identy changed in family roles, such as the role of women in the family unit, immigrants, and religious values
- Family roles:
	- Men out to work, Women to stay at home and teach kids/making their own stuff
		- More power than in England, but still very little power
- Immigrants
	- Indentured servants --> slaves
	- Protestants
	- Still primarily from England
- Religious
	- Diversity
	- Rhode Island: religious freedom
	- Puritain strict communities

# 9: In the Chesapeake colonies why did Africans become hereditary slaves serving for life instead of indentured servants bound for only several years? 
- Slaves in the Chesapeake colony were a replacement to the indentured servants before them because they were bound for life as not being bound for life caused issues with angry, poor, unemployed males looking for work resenting the upper class or just running away before the end of their term.
	- Once term ended, servants had nowhere to go, looking for jobs
	- Bacon's rebellion: angry former indentured servants settled in backcountry because that's the only place they could, but constant attacks by natives.
		- Governer did nothing
		- In response, many angry farmers attacked the governer and other parts of the colony
		- Former indentured servant owners saw this as turning point towards slaves as they were for life and would not cause this type of trouble after release.
	- Escaping:
		- Poor white indentured servants when escaping blended right into the colonies full of other poor white farmers, and were hard to catch if they escaped
		- Instead, African slaves were easy to track down by their skin color and by making it hereditary, made it easy for slave owners to say to African Americans that they "should" be a slave.
	- Free African Americans bad model to those working
	- Free/cheaper labor, no reason for headright system
