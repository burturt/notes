**Unit Overview**:  In 1945, the United States emerged from World War II with the world’s largest and strongest economy. Despite fears of a return to an economic depression, Americans were happy to get back to civilian life. What no one could predict was how the fall of colonial empires, the spread of Communism, and changes in the global economy would impact American lives in the future.
    At home, Americans enjoyed robust economic growth through the 1960’s with little competition, as the rest of the world’s economies recovered from the war. Pent up consumer demand for autos and housing combined with government road building projects quickly overcame the economic uncertainty after the war and introduced an era of unprecedented prosperity and economic growth. By the 1950’s, Americans enjoyed the highest standards of living achieved by any society in history. 
Democrats, expanding on the New Deal, enacted major domestic programs, such as Medicare, aid to education, and civil rights for African Americans and women.The 1960’s were in many ways both the best and the worst of times. On the one hand the postwar prosperity peaked in the 1960s. At the same time, racial strife, a controversial war in Vietnam and student radicalism started to tear the country apart. The Cold War against Communism governments dominated U.S. foreign policy. While the threat of the use of nuclear weapons kept the great powers from attacking each other, limited “hot” wars in Korea and Vietnam cost America more than 100,000 lives. By the late 1960’s frustration over the Vietnam War, and opposition to liberal domestic programs, such as civil rights, and increased civil unrest weakened the Democratic majority, which slowly gave way during the 1970’s to a conservative resurgence in 1980.

**Essential Question**: How did postwar America face the challenges of the Cold War amidst economic prosperity and advancement and how did the country respond to the ensuing liberal movements to effect social change?

**Key Concept 8**:
- 8.3   Postwar economic, demographic, and technological changes had a far-reaching impact on American society, politics, and the environment.
- 8.2   Liberalism, based on anti-communism abroad and a firm belief in the efficacy of government and especially federal power to achieve social goals at home, reached its apex in the mid-1960s and generated a variety of political and cultural responses.

# 5. Who constituted the “other America” who failed to share in the economic prosperity and affluence in the postwar era? Why were they left out?
- the "other america" mainly consisted of minorities and rural farmers
	- Elderly, African American, Hispanic, Native American, Immigrants, etc
		- discrimination/racism
	- Farmers hit hard with price decreases
- Countered via Lyndon B Johnson's Great Society
	- "War on poverty"
	- Medicare, Medicad, expanded Society Security
		

# 9.  Who were the major civil rights leaders and what were their strategies? Why did the civil rights movement become increasingly assertive and militant over the course of the 1960’s?

- Montogmery Bus Boycott
	- Strategy: protest via boycotts
- Martin Luther King Jr.
	- Civil Disobedience
	- March on Washington
		- Civil Rights Act

	- Black Panther

# 10. How did U.S. involvement in Vietnam escalate through the 1960’s? What were the political and social consequences of that escalation, in Vietnam and the United States?
- Ho Chi Mihn comunist North, Democratic South
- Eisenhower: domino theory
	- More troops needed to keep Democracy in power
	- In farewell address, warned against Military-Industrial Complex
- Kennedy:
	- Increase "military advisors"
- Johnson
	- Gulf of Tonkin incident
	- Believed sending more troops would mean victory
	- Fought Vietcong:

		- Lots of fighting in civilians
		- US now unpopular as they could not tell who was the Vietcong and who was just a citizen
- US: anti-war
	- Outraged after Tet offensive destroyed the US
