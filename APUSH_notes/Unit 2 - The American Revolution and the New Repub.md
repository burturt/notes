**Unit Overview**:  In less than fifty years the  British went from consolidating their control along the Atlantic coast of North America to watching 13 of their colonies unite in revolt and establish an independent nation. After the Seven Years’ War ended in 1763, the British desired more revenue to pay for protecting their empire while many American colonists saw themselves as self-sufficient. These clashing views resulted in the colonies declaring independence, winning a war, and founding a new nation. Initially governed by the Articles of Confederation with a weak federal government, the new United States soon replaced it with a new constitution that created a federal government that was stronger, though still with limited powers. Out of the debates over the new constitution and policies emerged two parties. The test of the stability of the American system came in 1800, when one party, the Federalists, peacefully transferred power to the other, the Democratic -Republicans. Throughout this period there was a continuous westward migration resulting in new opportunities, blended cultures, and increased conflicts with the American Indians and other European nations. 

**Essential Question**: How and why did the American colonies forge a new nation?

**Key Concept 3**:
British imperial attempts to reassert control over its colonies and colonial reaction to these attempts produced a new American republic, along with struggles over the new nation’s social, political, and economic identity.
- 3.1   Britain’s victory over France in the imperial struggle for North America led to new conflicts among the British government, the North American colonists, and American Indians, culminating in the creation of a new nation, the United States.
- 3.2   In the late 18th century, new experiments with democratic ideas and republican forms of government, as well as new religious, economic, and cultural ideas, challenged traditional imperial systems across the Atlantic World.
- 3.3   Migration within North America, cooperative interaction, and competition for resources raised questions about boundaries and policies, intensified conflicts among peoples and nations, and led to contests over the creation of a multiethnic, multiracial national identity.

# 4 What factors pushed the colonists from protest to revolution? 
- Context: French and Indian War/7 years war:
	- French and Settlers moved towards each other
	- Albany Congress: assemble colonial force to fight
		- Albany plan of union failed - not ready to unite yet
	- British won, 1763 Treaty:
		- French gone from America
		- British doubled land holdings --> Proclamation line of 1763
			- Unenforcable, colonists angry that land "they" fought for was not allowed to be used
			- Done by UK to reduce tensions with Natives and reduce tension with Spain/France
	- EXPENSIVE: Britain needed money --> taxes!
- **Taxes and regulations** passed by Britain:
	- UK tried to clamp down on taxes even though colonies had self-government (Salutary Neglect) --> unpopular
		- Navigation Acts stricter (stop smuggling)
	- **Quartering Act of 176**5
		- Colonists must quarter solider
	- Sugar (coffee, wine, luxury, molasses tax enforced)
	- Stamp Act 1765 - Angered those in power - press, wealthy
- **No Representation**:
	- Colonists: "No taxation without representation!"
	- Britain: "Virtual Representation" - Parliament represent classes of people, not areas
	- Angered colonists
- Groups:
	- Sons of Liberty
	- Daughters of Liberty
	- Stamp Act Congress: petition to Parliament
		- Stated taxation without representation is tyranny as reason for anger
		- NOT independence
	- Response:
		- Repealed acts because ineffective and hurt UK business with boycotts and violence
		- Declaratory Act
- Townshend Act:
	- More taxes
	- More organized protests and boycotts
		- Women helped spun own cloth and make own tea
- **1770: Boston Massacre**
	- Used as propaganda to increase support for "tyrranic British"
- Boston Tea Party:
	- Coercive Acts in response
	- New Quartering Acts
	- "Intolerable Acts"
		- Other colonies worried that they will be under direct rule of Britain
- Continental Congress:
	- Natural Rights (Enlightnment ideas)
	- Social Contract
	- Separation of Powers

# 8 What were the accomplishments and shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation and how did its weaknesses lead to the drafting of a new constitution?
Context: previous governments in colonies
- Self-governing
- Legislative-body ruled
- Articles largely imported this model of legislative government:
	- No executive and no Judicial
	- No national military force
	- Limited power to tax
Accomplishments:
- Northwest Ordinance of 1787:
	- Provided plan for how land became a territory and later a state
	- Abolished slavery in North West territory
- Foreign Policy handled effectively
	- Signed multiple treaties
	- Unable to enforce British troops leaving forts
- Showed how no executive and no judicial was a bad idea; paved way for powerful federal government even though colonists just left a powerful government
Shortcomings:
- No national army:
	- Shays' Rebellion:
		- Farmers unable to pay debt b/c taxes and inflation
		- Daniel Shays gathered and revolted
			- National Army failed to crush rebellion
		- Helped Constitution include executive power and army
