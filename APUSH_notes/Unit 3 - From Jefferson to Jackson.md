**Unit Overview**: The new republic worked to define itself during a time of rapid demographic, economic, and territorial growth. It increase suffrage; reformed its schools, prisons, and asylums; and developed its own art, literature, and philosophy. The cultural life in Jeffersonian America both embraced and strayed from Republican ideals.True to their ideals, Republicans focused on national education, a cultural identity and a commitment to cultural independence. Although overwhelmingly rural and agrarian, America was slowly moving slowly in the direction of an urban industrial society. A coherent transportation system began to develop and, as a result, cities grew and became centers of commerce, education and affluence. Conflict with Britain would rise again and lead the country into the War of 1812. Neither Britain nor the United States wanted their dispute to end in war but pressures leading up to war came from continued violations of U.S. neutral rights at sea and troubles with the British on the western frontier. The war achieved none of its goals but it had important consequences for the future development of the American republic. The election of James Monroe as president in 1816, two years after the last battle of the war, inaurgurated what one newspaper editorial characterized as the “Era of Good Feelings.” This perception of unity and harmony, however, can be misleading and oversimplified. Throughout the era people had heated debates over tariffs, the national bank, internal improvements, and public land sales. Sectionalism tensions over slavery were becoming ever more apparent. When Andrew Jackson won the presidency in 1828, he ushered in the Age of Jackson, the only president to ever have an “age” named after him. It is also called the Age of the Common Man or the Era of Jacksonian Democracy. Historians debate how much Jackson had on this time period but nonetheless, the changing politics of the Jacksonian years paralleled complex social and economic changes.
