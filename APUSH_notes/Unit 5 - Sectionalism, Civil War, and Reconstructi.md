Unit 5 - Sectionalism, Civil War, and Reconstruction

**Unit Overview**:  As the young nation grew in population and land, it struggled to resolve problems that ultimately lead to a bloody clash that brought “a new birth of freedom” and permanently changed the nature of the government. Following a philosophy of manifest destiny, land was added through negotiations, purchase, and war. With victory in the Mexican War, the United States secured its southern border and ports on the Pacific Ocean. Expansion and sectionalism intensified the differences over politics, economics and slavery. Opposition to slavery ranging from free soilers to abolitionists and an underground railroad grew in spite of fugitive slave laws and the Dred Scott decision. A series of compromises failed and, following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, a civil war ravaged the country. The Union victory ended the questions of slavery and states’ rights. Reconstruction brought confrontations between the executive and legislative branches, and between the federal government and state governments. As the freed African Americans established new lives, black codes and sharecropping were established to maintain their subservience.

**Essential Question**: How did the Civil War and its aftermath impact the United States?

**Key Concept 5**: As the nation expanded and its population grew, regional tensions, especially over slavery, led to a civil war – the course and aftermath of which transformed American society.
- 5.1 The United States became more connected with the world as it pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere and emerged as the destination for many migrants from other countries.
- 5.2 Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
- 5.3 The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested Reconstruction of the South settled the issue of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.

# 1 How did Manifest Destiny both reflect American nationalism and shape American identity?

Manifest Destiny reflected American nationalism as a god-given right to take over the rest of the land in the continent as they made arrangements with Canada and fought with Mexico to gain land all the way to the West Coast
- Manifest Destiny: Americans have a God-given right to go from coast-to-coast
- Nationalism
	- Spread the US's government to many people
	

- Texas:
	- US immigrants continued to enter Mexico illegally due to Manifest Destiny
		- US immigrants willing to defend land violently even if they didn't officially own it by the Mexican gov
	- 1835 Texas Revolution:	
		- Battle of the Alamo: "Remember the Alamo!"
		- Battle of San Jacinto: MX surrendered, Santa Anna forced to sign independence
			- MX not accepting treaty 
			- US rejected because would cause war
	- Mexican American War:
		- Fight to get the land we want in a war provoked by the US
			- Spot resolutions: Jackson was on offense and intentionally agitated Mexico
		- Gain lots of land for cheap (Mexian Cession)

		- US felt claim because Manifest Destiny
	- Election of 1884: Polk
		- 54' 40" or fight!
		- Get the land from Canada, all the way North
		- In the end, compromised for a treaty
		- 

# 4 What compromises attempted to resolve the conflicts over the expansion of slavery into new territories? To what degree were these compromises successful?
Compromises such as the Missouri Compromise, Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act attempted to resolve the conflicts over the expansion of slavery using various methods to keep the balance of slave and free power in Congress, though the acts largely failed to fully resolve and satisfy either party as both the North and South began to be suspicious of the other's intent.
- Missouri Compromise/1820
- Wilmot Provisio:
	- Threat that Mexican Seccion is slave-free
	- Angered South, not successful in resolving tension
- Compromise of 1850
	- CA free state
	- NM and UT given choice of slave or free
		- Angered South - wanted guarentee of expansion
	- Slavery ended in DC
	- Stricter Fugitive Slave law

		- Overturned Missouri Compromise line

- Dred Scott 1857
	- Scott sued for freedom on grounds that he lived in state with slavery illegal
	- Taney court ruled:
		- Slaves not citizens, could not sue
		- Slaves considered property: could not be "deprived of property"
	- Did not address differences; instead, gave slavery argument complete agreement by courts
	- Angered North
- Election of 1860: Lincoln vs Stephen Douglass
	- Lincoln with zero electoral votes from South 
	- South felt not represented anymore, and left before Lincoln took office
		- SC first
		- Created Confederate States of America, slavery allowed
		- Not all slave states left

# 9 What were the debates over, and the achievements of, Reconstruction? Where did it fail and why?
At the federal level, many debates occured between the Republicans and President Johnson over how to reintegrate the confederacy, with many policies such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th amendment granting equal rights to all men forced through Johnson by a republican supermajority, but reconstruction was less successful and failed in the South where Black Codes were instituted and the Compromise of 1877 left Southern African Americans unprotected against white supremesit violence.
