Unit 6 - Industrial America: The "Gilded Age"

**Unit Overview**:  Historians have labeled the period in many ways. For some it is the “Second Industrial Revolution,: which introduced the wonders of electric-powered technologies, petroleum energy, and the first industrial laboratories. Others called it the “Railroad Era,” which produced a continental network of railroads that could move the products of the new large-scale industries. For some it is the “Last Frontier,” which witnessed the settlement of lands between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean, and the end of the “Indian Wars.” However, the characterization that has most endured is the “Gilded Age,” a time during which the “captains of industry” controlled large corporations, created great fortunes, and dominated politics, while the problems of farmlands and burgeoning cities festered under the surface.
           During the late 1800’s, waves of “new” immigrants also added to the growth of the nation, while reformers, labor unions, farmer organizations, and a growing middle class began to challenge economic, political, and cultural institutions. It was during this time period that the United States emerged as the largest economy in the world and a potential international power.
