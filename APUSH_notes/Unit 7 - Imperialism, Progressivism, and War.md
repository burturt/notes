**Unit Overview**:  As the United States industrialized in the late 19th century, it also intensified its foreign involvement, partly because it wanted both sources of raw materials for manufacturing and worldwide markets for its growing quantity if industrial and agricultural products. A principal target of American imperialism was the nearby Caribbean area. Expansionists from the South had coveted Cuba as early as the 1850’s. Now in the 1890’s, large American investments in Cuban sugar, Spanish misrule of Cuba, and the Monroe Doctrine all provided justification for U.S. intervention in the Caribbean’s largest island.
            By the turn of the century, a reform movement had developed that included a wide range of groups and individuals with a common desire to improve life in the industrial age. Their ideas and work became known as progressivism, because they wanted to build on the existing society, making moderate political changes and social improvements through government action. This progressive movement was complicated, however, by a growing European war that threatened U.S. involvement. During a relatively short period (1914-1919),the United States and its people rapidly moved through a wide range of roles; first as a contented neutral country, next as a country waging a war for peace, then as a victorious world power, and finally, as an alienated and isolationist nation.

**Essential Question**: How did America become a world power and what domestic and international challenges did industrialization and America’s role in the world present?
