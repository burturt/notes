Unit 8 - 1920's and The Great Depression

**Unit Overview**:  Politics took a backseat in the 1920’s as Americans adapted to economic growth and social change. The decade began with a brief postwar recession, included a lengthy period of business prosperity, and ended in economic disaster with the nation’s worst stock market crash. During the boom years, unemployment was low and the standard of living for most Americans improved significantly. More than half of the American population lived in urban areas. However, the culture of the cities was increasingly at odds with the strict religious and moral codes of rural America. High school and college youth expressed their rebellion against their elders’ culture by dancing to jazz music, which became the symbol of the “new” and “modern” culture of the cities. 
The depression of the 1930’s lasted longer and caused more business failures and affected more people-- both middle class and working class -- than any preceding period of hard times. This was in fact not just an ordinary depression but the Great Depression. President Hoover, who relied on what he believed was the “rugged individualism” of Americans, was reluctant to use the full resources of the government to pull the country out of its slump. It would be up to Franklin D. Roosevelt who would expand the size of the federal government and the role of the presidency to experiment with political solutions to the country’s economic problems.

**Essential Question**: Why did America suffer a Great Depression after such a booming economy in the 1920’s,  and what was the impact on the nation and the role of the federal government?

**Key Concept 7**:
- 7.2 A revolution in communications and transportation technology helped to create a new mass culture and spread “modern” values and ideas, even as cultural conflicts between groups increased under the pressure of migration, world wars,
             and economic distress.
- 7.1.III National, state, and local reformers responded to economic upheavals, laissez-faire capitalism, and the Great Depression by transforming the United States into a limited welfare state.
