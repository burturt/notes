Unit 9 - World War II and The Origins of the Cold War

**Unit Overview**:  World War I was meant to be a “war to end all wars” and, as Woodrow Wilson had said, a war to “make the world safe for democracy.” In 1933, however, few people  believed that the fragile peace established by the Treaty of Versailles would hold up for much longer. In Asia, Japan was threatening China. In Europe, the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany with promises of reasserting aggressive German nationalism and militarism. Public opinion in the United States was also nationalistic but expressed itself in an opposite way from fascism and militarism and worries about the depression overshadowed concerns about a second world war. Even if war did break out, Americans were determined not to send troops abroad again. However, a second world war did occur, and the United States played a major role in fighting it. On December 7, 1941, while most American sailors were still asleep in their bunks, Japanese planes from aircraft carriers flew over Pearl Harbor in a “day that will live in infamy.” Few people opposed the war and every group in the U.S. population adjusted to the unique circumstances of wartime. As soldiers fought on two fronts, or two “theaters of operations,” the war was transforming the American economy and society in many ways more dramatically than the New Deal.
