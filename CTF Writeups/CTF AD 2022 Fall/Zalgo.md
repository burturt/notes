## Challenge text
Here's some code that prints the entire script of Shrek! Yup, that's the only thing it does!

[shrek.py](../../_resources/shrek.py)

Hint: A little Reddit OSINT might be helpful :) We love open source code.

Note: Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
## Solution
- Before I say anything, I will say that my team only managed to solve this after multiple hints about the fact that what reddit post we are looking for has a) been in the last year and b) has nothing to do with shrek
- First off, in the code, we see some "Shrek" variable, and then what appears to be the entirety of the Shrek movie script
- What exactly is in this shrek variable? A lot of zalgo, in fact so much that it is around 90000 characters long!
	- Side note: zalgo is text that abuses various unicode diacritic marks (like the - in ē) to place a crazy number of these overlayed marks onto the text to make it extremely messy. For example,  `Ţ̵̨̛͎͔͎̪̱̦̺̪͍̳͆̇̊̋̄̑͌͜͜h̸̖́͐̐̈̇̎ì̴̢̛̛̮͔̣͑̅́͆̄͆̽̉̆͐͜͝͠ş̷̡̬̰͇̪͚̰̝̝͐ ̶̟̫̙̺̰̣͓̠̱͒̓̒͐̅͆͝͠ḯ̸̛̙̜͕͑̊̃͂̏̊̾̈́̑͌s̸̢̞̠̥͎̼̟͙̰̘̗͇͝͠ͅ ̸͕̪̰̞̩͑̂͐̓́́̈́́̎̎̏͋͆̉͘͘z̵̭͕͍̉̅͒͂́̔̈̾͗a̸̢͕͍̮̩͙̩͙̹͕̋̃͂̈́̆͒͛̑̇͛̚ͅͅl̴̰̗͖̀̅̀͆̽̒̒͑͑̄̎̈́̈́̉̕̕ģ̷̛͙͇̗̮̣͚̺̗̞̈̌̿̂̈̋̾̎̑o̸̥̼͆̋̋͌́̆̋͐̔̌̿͐͘` (if it isn't rendering properly: ![Screen Shot 2022-11-20 at 8.07.20 PM.png](../../_resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-20%20at%208.07.20%20PM.png))
