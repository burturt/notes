## Challenge text
Lima Bean is a senior at Rice University. He used to work as a Project Manager for Super Secure Systems, but recently got a job at Brick. What's his current job title?
## Solution
- Immediately we are given information about a person's education and job. One of the central websites to get this information is linkedin, so that's what I'm going to assume the target is.
- Attempt 1: going to linkedin directly and searching up just "Lima Bean Rice" on linkedin yields no results... curious
- Attempt 2: let's try google! `site:linkedin.com Lima Bean {hint}` all yields completely random results, none of which are useful where {hint} is something like `rice`, `super secure systems`, `brick`, etc
- Attempt 3: So, linkedin is actually owned by microsoft, and from my previous experience messing with linkedin and privacy controls, bing (microsoft's search engine) actually updates linkedin much faster than google. Trying any of the above searches immediately results in this: ![Screen Shot 2022-11-20 at 7.57.12 PM.png](../_resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-20%20at%207.57.12%20PM.png). Success! One note, if you actually visit the link, the linkedin page no longer exists... My guess is that linkedin, in its quest to remove fake accounts, found this account and deleted it but because bing indexes linkedin quickly and thoroughly, it saw it before getting removed.
