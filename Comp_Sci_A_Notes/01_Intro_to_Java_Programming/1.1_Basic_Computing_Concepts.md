1.1 Basic Computing Concepts

- Why programming?
	- Learn how to do algorithms
	- You need to teach a computer how to do algorithms in order to fully grasp algorithms
	- "algorithmic thinking"
- Hardware and Software
	- Computers run programs
	- CPU executes instructions 
	- RAM stores data that CPU needs
		- RAM is ephemeral and is wiped on power loss 
	- HDD or SSD stores persistent data that CPU doesn't need right now
- Digital realm
	- Computers use binary:
		- "on/off"
			- Sidenote: the wire isn't actually going from 100% on to 100% off, it goes from above a threshold to below a threshold. This is also where signal degredation can come from where the difference between 1 and 0 is hard to distinguish

| Decimal | Binary |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 11 |
| 4 | 100 |
| 8 | 1000 |
| 2^5 | 100000 |
| 2^n | 1 followed by n zeros |

- **Note to reader: this is NOT a good place to learn binary if you haven't seen it before. This is supposed to only be a refresher**

- Process of Programming
	- execution: running instructions in a program
	- compilter: translates a program in one language into another language
		- in java, it goes from human-readable java code to machine-readable java bytecode
	- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
		- A virtual computer that only understands java bytecode
		- the JRE (Java Runtime Enviornment) does this work
			- Actually executes the code
- Why Java?
	- Object oriented
		- Avoid "goto hell"
		- Fast to write complex programs
	- Cross-compatible with many OSs
	- Many Libraries
		- Collecitons of existing code you can use in your programs
	- Widely adopted
- 3 basic steps:
	- Write the program in java class(es)
	- Compile the program
	- Run the program
