1.2 And Now-Java

- Java elements:
	- Class: a unit of code that is the basic building block of Java programming
		- Basic description, see chapter 8 for more info
		- File format:
```java
<libraries imported>
public class <name> {
	<method>
	<method>
	...
}
```
- Method:
	- A program unit that represents a particular action or computation
- Statement: 
	- An executable snippet of code that represents a complete command:
		- `System.out.println("Hello, world!");`
	- All statements end with semicolons in java

- String Literals (Strings)
	- a literal just means "actually what it is" and not pointing at some value. I.E. a number is a literal but a variable is not
	- String Literals are surrounded by **double** quotes.
		- `"This is an amazing string!"`
		- Cannot be multiline
- `System.out.println`
	- `System.out.println();` prints an empty line
		- You MUST include parenthesis even if nothing is in them (zero arguments)
	- `System.out.println("some text");`
		- If you pass text into it, you give it an argument
- Escape Sequences:
	- Escape sequences are text "sequences" that represent something else
		- For instance, `\t` is a tab, `\n` is a newline, `\"` is actually a quote character, and `\\` is a single backslash character"
	- `System.out.println("What \"characters\" does this \\ print?");` --> `What "characters" does this \ print?`
	- `System.out.println("These\nare\multiple\nlines");` -->
```
These
are
multiple
linee
```
- print vs println
	- println prints a new line after the text, print does not
- Indentifiers and Keywords:
	- Identifier: A name given to an entity in a program, such as a class or method
		- contains alphanumeric characters + `_` or `$`s.
		- Cannot start with a number
	- Comventions:
		- Classes, capitalize first letter and first letter of all words after that
			- `CoffeeMachineConsole`
		- method names start lowercase, first letter of words after that capitzalized
			- `getCoffee`
			- `spillCoffeeOnFloor`
		- constants are all CAPS and underscroll between words
			- `TAX_RATE`
			- `COFFEE_COST`
			
	- Java is cAsE SenSiTIve
	- Keywords: reserved words that should not be used as Identifiers
		- ex: `for` `if` `try` `void` `public`

- Comments and Readability
	- whitespaces (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc) do not matter
	- this is a valid program but ugly:
```java
public class Ugly{public static void main(String[] area)
{System.out.println("How short I am!");}}
```
- rules:
	- class and method headers on lines by themselves
	- one statement per line
	- indent when newlining with open parenthesis/braces
	- use blank lines to separate places
- Comments:
	- Start comment with `/*`, end with `*/`
	- One-line comment: `this.is.a.statement(); // this is a comment`
```java
/* this is a comment */
/ * this is not a comment and may error * /
/* this
is
a
multiline
comment
*/
/* this
 * is
 * an easier to read
 * multiline comment
*/

System.out.println("hi"); // one-line comment
// one-line comment by itself
// System.out.print("this will not execute");
```
