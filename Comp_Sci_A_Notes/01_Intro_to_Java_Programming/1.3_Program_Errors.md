1.3 Program Errors

#### **1. Programming by definition includes lots of debugging**
1. Syntax Errors
	- Misuse java, "bad grammar", caught by compiler
2. Logic Errors
	- Code runs but does not perform as expected
3. Runtime Errors
	- Logic errors that prevent java from running the program, caught by JRE

### Syntax Errors:
- Reported by compiler
- Prevents program from being run at all
	- Some IDEs like Eclipse give hints
##### Common errors:
- File name does not match class name
	- HelloWorld.java with Helloworld class
- Misspelled Words
	- `System.out.pruntln();`
- Forgetting a Semicolon
	- `System.out.println()`
- Forgetting a Required Keyword
	- `public void main(String[] args)`

###### Note: Java will usually give you a pointer at where the error occured. Use this to debug the program!

### Logic Errors:
- aka "bugs"
- Harder to catch
##### Examples:
- Divide by zero
- Printing wrong output
