Algorithms

### Algorithm: “a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations”
- Have a starting point
- Have Input
- Process something
- Have output
- Have a stopping point

ex:
- **I have**: an untied shoe
- **I want**: to tie them so I don't trip on the laces when I walk.
- Preconditions: Knowing left from right hands, has hands, is wearing said shoe, knows what a loop is and how to form one
- The algorithm:
1. Grab the laces with your right and left hands
2. Cross the right shoelace over the left one
3. Tuck the right shoelace under the left lace 
4. Pull the right shoelace to the left, over the left one
5. Pull on the left shoelace to the right
6. Form a loop using the left shoelace
7. Wrap the left lace around the base of the loop all the way around such that you end with the left lace still pointing right.
8. Form a loop using the left lace
9. Push the left lace through the center of the right lace's hole
10. Pull the two loops taught until it catches but do not pull it all the way through
