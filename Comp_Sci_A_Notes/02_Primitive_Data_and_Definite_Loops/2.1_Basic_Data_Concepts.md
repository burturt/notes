2.1 Basic Data Concepts

- "type-safe" language:
	- Be explicit about the type of information
	- Prevents unexpected behavior when the language operates on the number as one thing when you didn't want it to
- Java:
	- Primitive data AND objects
### Primitive Types:
- `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `double`, `float`, `int`, `long`, `short`
	- boolean, char, double and int "fundamental"
	- These are java keywords
- Int vs reals (double, float):
	- int is exact, double is approx.
	- double is more precise than float
### Expressions:
- A simple value or a set of operatores that produces a value
- "literals":
	- Literally the value
	- `5`, `23.5`
- evaluation:
	- Obtaining the value of an expression
	- `(2 * 6) + (4 * 4) + 2` evaluates to 30
- Operator:
	- A special symbol that indicates an operation
- Operand:
	-
