2.2 Variables!

### Key vocab:

- Variable: A memory location with a name and a type that stores a value
- Declaration: A request to set aside memory for a new variable
- Uninitialized variables: Variables that were declared but not assigned a value yet
- Assignment statement: A statement that assigns a value to a variable
- String Concatenation: Combining strings and other data into a single string
- Incrementing: Increasing the value of a variable
- Decrementing: Decreasing the value of a variable
- Promoting: Implicitly changing one type into another in a non-destructive way, like an int into a double.

### Main ideas:

- Declare a variable like "TYPE NAME;", initialize a value like "NAME = VALUE;", or do both at once like "TYPE NAME = VALUE;"

- Declare multiple variables like "TYPE NAME, NAME = VALUE, NAME, ...;"

- A possible programming error is to declare a variable twice. You can only declare a variable once; after that, you must only assign values to it.

- You can combine strings and other types using +, like "My " + 3.14 + " String"

- You can increment or decrement from a variable's value using NAME OPERATION= Value (same as NAME = NAME OPERATION Value)

- You can use NAME++; or NAME--; (post decrement) or ++NAME; or --NAME; (pre decrement) to change by one.

- You can mix types and java will automatically Promote a value if possible
