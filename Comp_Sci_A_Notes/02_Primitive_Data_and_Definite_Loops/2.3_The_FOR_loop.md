2.3 The FOR loop

```java
for (<initialization>; <continuation test>; <update>) {
	<statement>;
	<statement>;
}

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
	System.out.println("i is " + i);
}
```

Key vocab:
- Control Structure: A syntactic structure that controls other statements, like for loops
- For Loops: A loop that consists of a header with an initialization, continuation test, and update statements and expressions.
Control variable: The variable used to control a loop
Iteration: One execution of a controlled statement of a loop.
- Nested for loops: Placing for loops in each other

Main Ideas:
- For loop: A for loop first runs the initialization statement, then it runs in order the test, body, update, and repeats. If the test is false, then the loop terminates. The variable used to control the number of iterations of the loop is called the "control variable". Each time the loop is executed, one iteration has occurred. 
- Nesting for loops: Nesting for loops allows code to become more complex, for example printing a multiplication table as one loop is needed for the horizontal direction and one for the vertical direction.
