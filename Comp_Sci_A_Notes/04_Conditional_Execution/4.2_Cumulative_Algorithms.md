4.2 Cumulative Algorithms

Cumulative Algorithm: An operation in which an overall value is computed incrementally, often using a loop
### Cumulative sum
`sum = sum + next` is the same as `sum += next`
peudocode:
```java
 sum = 0;
 for (all numbers to sum) {
	 obtain "next";
	 sum += next;
 }
```
Things to think about:
1. How to get # of times to run?
2. How to obtain "next" value?
3. What number should the culumative variable start at?
4. What else to keep track of? If you need to keep track of min or max, add an if statement that checks the next variable on every iteration and updates cumulative variables accordingly.
### Example: print out hailstone sequence max and min
(3x + 1) if x is odd
(x/2) if x is even
Example code:
```java
public static void printHailstoneMaxMin(int value, int length) {
	// Set up cumulative variables for max and min
	int max = value;
	int min = value;
	// Run # of times as length
	for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
		// Check if even and do appropriate action
		if (value % 2 == 0) {
			value /= 2;
		} else {
			value = 3 * value + 1;
		}
		// Check for min and max changing
		if (value > max) {
			max = value;
		} else if (value < min) {
			min = value;
		}
	}
	System.out.println("max = " + max + ". min = " + min);
}
```

### Roundoff Error:
- An error that occurs because floating point numbers are stored as approximations rather than as exact values
	- Due to base 10 not evenly represented in base 2.
	- Use ints for exact values
	- Do not expect to be able to compare double for equality. Instead, use a test like `Math.abs(double1 - double2) < 0.001` to test for accuracy.

```java
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
```
