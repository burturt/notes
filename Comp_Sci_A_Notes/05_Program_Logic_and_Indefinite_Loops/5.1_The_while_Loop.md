5.1 The while Loop

Big Ideas and vocab:

While Loop: A loop that runs a test then continues if the test is true. Best if the loop is run an indefinite # of times (i.e. stop when something is false, not stop after x runs).

Infinite loops: While loops can easily be written to be infinite! Make sure that the loop will _always_ terminate regardless of the variable values going into the loop.

Random methods (create random object Random r = new Random(); and import java.util.Random;):

Math.random(): Pseudorandom number [0, 1)

r.nextInt(): Random int between -2^31 and 2^31-1 (range of int values)

r.nextInt(max): Random int between 0 and max-1

r.nextDouble(): Random double [0.0, 1.0)

r.nextBoolean(): true or false, random

Pseudorandom Numbers: numbers that are generated using a predictable algorithm that acts randomly. Do not use if you cannot let attacker guess the random number!

Priming a loop: Setting up variables that will be used in a loop to guarantee the loop is entered
