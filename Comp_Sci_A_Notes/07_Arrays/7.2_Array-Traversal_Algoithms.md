7.2 Array-Traversal Algoithms

## Two ways to traverse array:
1. Traversing loop
```java
for (int i = 0; i < <array>.length; i++) {
	<do something with array[i] and possibly i>;
}
```
2. For-each loop
```java
for (<type> <name> : <array>) {
	<do something with name>;
}
```
## Printing array
`Arrays.toString(<array>);` --> `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
or if you want custom print, use a loop:
```java
for (<type> <name> : <array>) {
	System.out.println(<name>);
}
```
Use commas between elements but no comma at end:
```java
if (<array>.length != 0) {
	System.out.print(<array>[0]);
	for (int i = 1; i < <array>.length; i++) {
		System.out.print(", " + list[i]);
	}
	System.out.println();
} else {
	System.out.println("[]");
}
```
## Searching and Replacing
Tips:
- Use for-each loop then increment counter to search for # of element in array
- Create method with regular for loop but return the index when you found the element for searching for location
	- Make sure you return *something* if the search fails to find anything!
	- Use myString.equals(targetString); for strings
## Array equality
`Arrays.equals(list1, list2);`
"equal" means same # of elements and each element at each index is the same.
- You may want custom equality algorithms. Use a for loop and check the element i in both with the comparison you need
## Reversing an array
- Store variable in temp to swap:
```java
int temp = list[i];
list[i] = list[j];
list[j] = temp;
```
Loop this as a method:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < list.length / 2; i++) {
	int j = list.length - i - 1;
	swap(list,i , j);
}
```
Note: when you pass an object into a method, since the object is like a remote control that "points" to a place in memory with buckets, any changes made on it inside the method will stay!
## String traversal algorithms
- Same as arrays!
	- s.length() instead of list.length
	- To change a character at an index, do s.substring(0, i) + char + s.substring(i + 1); as strings are immutable


```java
String s = "hello there!";
char[] c = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e', '!'};

s.charAt(1); // 'e'
c[1]; // 'e'

s.charAt(1) = 'a'; // ERROR: you'll get something vague, but basically strings are immutable and you can't "assign" a value to a method
c[1] = 'a'; // Perfectly fine as c[1] is referring to the actual char "bucket" within the array

// However, you can work with both s.charAt and c[i] as both "return" a char:
Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(1)); // 'E';
Character.toUpperCase(c[1]); // 'A' since we changed this above, but the idea that you can work with it as a character still stands.

// This actually gets even more complicated when we start creating our own objects, but that's for sometime later in the course

// Last thing: since c[i] refer to the actual thing inside of the array, running methods on objects stored in them *will* persist (confusing, I know?)
// For this, assume we have a class CoffeeMug that we can .fill() and .drink() and can do .isEmpty() which returns a boolean
// For example, see the following code:
CoffeeMug myCoffee = new CoffeeMug();
myCoffee.fill();
myCoffee.isEmpty(); // false
myCoffee.drink();
myCoffee.isEmpty(); // true

// Now let's make an array of CoffeeMugs!
CoffeeMug[] coffeeTray = {new CoffeeMug(), new CoffeeMug(), new CoffeeMug()}; // Make new array with 3 of them
CoffeeMug[1].drink()
```
