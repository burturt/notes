7.3 Reference Semantics

Value Semantics: A type of system where values are stored directly and copying creates independent copies. In java, these are the primitives.
Reference Semantics: The "value" stored is a reference to somewhere in memory, so copying only copies this reference; modifying through a copy of the reference affects all references to the object. In java, these are the objects.

Working with Multiple Objects:
```java
int[] list1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] list2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] list3 = list2;
```
list1 and list2 reference 2 different objects in memory, and as such a modification on one does not affect the other. However, list 2 and 3 point to the same object in memory, so list3[1] = 1 is the same as list2[1] = 1!.

list2 == list3 is true, but list1 == list2 is false because they are not the same object in memory. If you want to evaluate if they are equal with the same length and values, you should use the Arrays.equals(list1, list2) class instead. If you need a full copy, use Arrays.copyOf();

Null: The keyword null is for an object variable to not reference any object in memory. This is NOT the same as an empty object as the empty object like a string still has a value that is empty while a null value does not have any value stored.
