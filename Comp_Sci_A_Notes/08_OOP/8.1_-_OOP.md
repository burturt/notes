8.1_-_OOP

8.1 - OOP

Starting Defintions:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Using a program as a set of objects rather than as a set of actions
- Object: A programming entity that contains states (data) and behaviors (methods/functions)
- State: A set of values (internal data) stored in an object
- Behavior: A set of actions that an object can perform, often modifying or reporting its internal state
- Client (Code): Code that interacts with a class or objects of that class

Main Ideas:
- **Objects are not programs by themselves!** They are simply a component of a program that has a specific role or task that it performs. Use Client code or other objects to communicate with objects
- Interacting with an object: Point Object example
```java
Point p = new Point(3, 8);
// p is now a reference towards a new object of the Point class in memory
p.translate(1,2);
// This is a method. Interally, there is 2 "buckets" of variables that store the x and y position. The translate method modifies the values
p.x = 12;
p.y = 3;
// This assigns the attribute "buckets" new values.
// You can also use this to get the values and do stuff with it:
int sum = p.x + p.y;
```
What I will find useful: I think this review of exactly what objects are will be useful after we've touched on some pretty difficult OOP concepts.
