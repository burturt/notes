8.2_-_Object_State_and_Behavior

8.2 - Object State and Behavior

Parts of a method:
- Fields
- Methods
- Constructors
- Encapsulation

### Fields:
- Special variables that are stored as part of the internal state of an object
	- "instance variable", "data member", "attribute"
	- Access fields using `<object variable>.<name of field>`. Can use variables as normal.
	- Declare fields like a normal variable but outside of any method inside of a class
	- Each object has its own set of non-static fields.
### Methods
- A method in an object that operates on the object.
	- AKA "instance methods"
	- Run methods using `<object variable>.<name of method>(<arguments, comma separated)`
	- Create methods like before but not statically (don't include static as keyword)
### Implicit Parameter
- Object methods have implicit access to the object's fields and methods
- You can run methods and change variables without needing to reference the object in the method itself
### Mutators and Accessors:
- Fancy names for different types of methods:
	- Mutators change the value of an object's field
	- Accessors retrieve/return the value of an object's field
### Using toString for objects
- Make a new method `public String toString()` in your object and return a string for how the object should look like when printed. This will be implicitly called when doing `System.out.println(obj)` or can be called outright `obj.toString()`
