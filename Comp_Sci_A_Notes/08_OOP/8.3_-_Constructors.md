8.3 - Constructors

### Constructor
- Constructor: Code in a method that tells java how to handle arguments passed into the parameters of a new object, "constructing the object".

- Constructors look like:
  ```java
  public CLASSNAME(type name, type2 name2, ...) {
  	statements;
  }
  ```
  where classname is the same as the name of the class and the type list is the list of arguments you need to pass to a new Object(PARAMETERS) when creating the object.
- By default, if you leave this out, there is a default constructor that initializes the variables but does not do anything else.
- Note: there is no void keyword! Adding void turns this into a regular method, not a constructor. 

### Keyword this
- To refer to an instance variable and not a local variable "
shadowing" the instance variable, use the keyword `this.VARIABLE`. In general, `this` refers to the object the code is in.

### Multiple Constructors
- You can have multiple constructors as long as all of the constructors take in different parameter sets, aka a unique signature.
- It is good practice to "centralize" all of your constructors to one point, so if a constructor of nothing was to be called, you can call `this(value)` to run the main constructor with a default value instead of re-creating the constructor code
