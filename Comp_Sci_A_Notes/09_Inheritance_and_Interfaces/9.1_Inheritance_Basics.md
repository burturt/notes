9.1 Inheritance Basics

# Inheritance:
### Nonprogramming Hierarchies - example
```md
        Employee
   --------|---------
   |       |        |
   v       v        v
Lawyer Secretary Marketer
           |
		   v
	 Legal Secretary
```
- Every "node" on the tree is also one of the larger class above it
	- All are a type of employee, and legal secretary is a type of secretary
	- Anything that applies to employee also applies to everything below it
	- Something that applies to secretary applies to legal secretary but not neccesarily an employee or other types like Marketer
- Why?
	- Easier to make changes - make change to employee to change for all employees, not individually multiple times
	- More standardized organization
- A connection in a hirearchy is called an "Is-a Relationship"
	- ex. A Secretary is a Employee, a Legal Secretary is a Secretary
- A hirearchy connected by is-a relationships is called an Inheritance Hirearchy
### Programming Example
```java
public class Employee {
	public int getHours() {
		return 40;
	}
	public double getSalary() {
		return 40_000.0;
	}
}
```
However, let's make another class for a Secretary:
```java
public class Secretary extends Employee {
	public double getSalary() {
		return 50_000.0;
	}
	public void repeat(String text) {
		System.out.println("Record: " + text);
	}
}
```
What is happening?
- The Employee class has 2 methods
- The Secretary class is a **subclass** of Employee, and Employee is a **superclass** of Secretary
- All of the methods in Employee are available in Secretary
	- However, the getSalary() method was overridden so calling Secretary.getSalary() will run the new method in Secretary, not the one in Employee.
Usage example:
```java
Employee me = new Employee();
System.out.println(me.getHours()); // 40
System.out.println(me.getSalary()); // 40000.0
System.out.println(me.repeat("test")); // ERROR: method does not exist in Employee class

Secretary them = new Secretary();
System.out.println(them.getHours()); // 40
System.out.println(them.getSalary()); // 50000.0
System.out.println(them.repeat("test")); // Record: test
```

What I will find useful: I will find useful the concept of inheritance to prevent redundant code with is-a relationships.
