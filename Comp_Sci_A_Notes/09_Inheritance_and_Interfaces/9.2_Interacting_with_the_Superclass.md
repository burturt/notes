9.2 Interacting with the Superclass

## Calling Overridden Methods
- Call superclass-only methods with `super` keyword, like `super.getSalary()`
	- Allows calling methods overridden
## Accessing Inherited Fields
- You cannot accces private fields from a superclass because encaptulation to prevent sub classes messing with super classes
- Instead, use getters and setters
## Calling a superclass's Constructor
- Use `super(Parameters)` to call constructor.
	- `super(1, 3.56, "hello")`
## Object class:
- Object class is the ultimate superclass of all java classes, even those not specified in headers.
- Useful Methods in Object class:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| clone()| return a copy of the object (not public) |
| equals(obj) | check if 2 objects are idential. By default checks if same object, not same fields |
| toString() | converts object to string. Called implicitly when casting to string |

### Equals:
- `==` cannot be used on objects because they check for exactly the same object, not equivalent state
- Default .equals class acts exactly like `==`
- You can override equals method to properly check state:
	- `public boolean equals(Object o)`
## Instanceof keyword
- Tests if an object is a specified class. Boolean operator
- `"test" instanceof String // true`
- `"test" instanceof Point // false`
- `null instanceof String // false`
- Use instanceof check in object class before attempting to compare data

I think I will find useful the ability to call the superclass's methods and access the superclass's fields via methods as well as overwriting Object default fields with .equals using the instanceof operator to check that the equals object is the same type of object.
