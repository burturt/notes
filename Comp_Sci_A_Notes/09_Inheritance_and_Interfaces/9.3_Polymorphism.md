9.3 Polymorphism

# Polymorphism!
- The ability for the same code to be used with different types of objects!
	- ex. if an Employee object has .getSalary, and Lawyer extends Employee but has a overridden .getSalary class, a method with parameter `Employee e` can call e.getSalary() and the method will get run, Employee, Lawyer, or otherwise that is a subclass of Employee
		- Note: ALL methods attempted to be called via polymorphism *must* be available in all possible objects called. i.e. if employee doesn't have a .signDocument() method but Lawyer does, you cannot create `Employee e` then do e.signDocument() even if the object passed to the variable has the method.
			- If you need to run subclass methods, you can cast the object like `((Secretary) e).takeDictation("test");` to one above or below in the hirearchy.
Full example:
```java
public class Employee {
	public double getSalary() {
		return 4500.0;
	}
	public void signDocument(String d) {
		System.out.println("Signed " + d + "!");
	}
}
public class Lawyer extends Employee {
	public double getSalary() {
		return 5555.55;
	}
	public String writeDocument() {
		return "go ask my paralegal, signed lawyer.";
	}
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Employee[] es = {new Employe(), new Lawyer()};
	for (Employee e : es) {
		System.out.println(e.getSalary()); // Prints out salary correctly
		if (e instanceof Lawyer) {
			System.out.println(e.writeDocument()); // ERROR: method does not exist even though only Lawyers ever have this method run, employees need to have it as well.
			System.out.println(((Lawyer) e).writeDocument()); // Prints out line properly. Note there will be runtime error if something could not be casted into a Lawyer, hence the instanceof check
		}
		
	}
}
```
I think I will find useful the concept of polymorphism to help reduce code reuse when it comes to common methods in objects, as well as being able to use it in my own code.
