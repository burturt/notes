9.4 Inheritance and Design

### Misuse of Inheritance
- ONLY use inheritance for is-a relationship.
	- Minecraft is a game, but Creative Mode is not a minecraft!
	- Everything that applies to the superclass *must* also translate to the subclass so the subclass can be substituted in place of the superclass and have no working changes, also known as **substitutability**.
	- Sometimes, it is a **has-a relationship** instead. Minecraft has-a Creative Gamemode, a Book has-a table of contents, etc
		- To do this, store the has-a \_\_\_ as a object inside of the class as a field instead of extending
### Updating Libraries:
- Backward compatibility is a huge thing in coding
	- Inheritance plus polymorphism allows for this!
		- Make method extend original method, make changes, and polymorphism means methods can return the new object but polymorphism allows legacy programs to use the new object just like the old class

One thing I will find useful in my own code is knowing when to use inheritance and when not to use inheritance.
