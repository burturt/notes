9.5 Interfaces

## Interfaces
- An interface is a type that is a list of "promises" of methods that classes promise to implement but behave similarily to other classes that also implement that interface
	- Think superclass polymorphism except there is no superclass implementation; implementation is all done in subclasses
	- Example: If you were to be certified in some field, it is assumed you know how to do stuff in that field. An interface could be the list of "things" that the person should know how to do and can do, but the actual implementation of how the person does it can vary while still being able to ask anyone the same task and get a similar result.
## Coded example: Shapes
- Interface shapes:
	- No shared formulas
	- Calculations for area and perimeter are shared
	- Note the method header just ends in `;` - no implementations are referenced in the interface
Interface:
```java
public interface Shape {
	public double getArea();
	public double getPerimeter();
}
```
Rectangle class:
```java
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
	private double width, height;
	/* other methods and fields and constructor */
	public double getArea() {
		return width * height;
	}
	public double getPerimeter() {
		return 2 * width + 2 * height;
	}
}
```
- Notice how the methods promised in the interface are implemented in the class
- Class header has implements keyword to show implementation

Let's try one more shape as an example:
```java
public class Circle implements Shape {
	private double radius;
	/* other methods and fields and constructor not shown */
	public double getArea() {
		return radius * 2 * Math.PI;
	}
	public double getPerimeter() {
		return radius * radius * Math.PI;
	}
}
```

## Benefits:
- Creates a hirearchy without fully extending a class
- Achieve polymorphism between is-a relationships that still may wildly vary
	- Refer to `Shape circle = new Circle(5.3);` still
- Can inherit multiple interfaces, not just 

What can I use in my own code: Now that I know how to use interfaces, I can start using them to make my code even more structured and hirearchial even when multiple things are a is-a relationship yet share almost no implementation but share methods or functions.
