9.6 Case study: Financial Class Hirearchy

When designing and Object-Oriented Design (a program that is a collection of objects using hirearchies), ask questions:
- What classes of objects should I write?
- What behaviors do each object have?
- What data needs to be stored?
- What relationships are there, and how?

### Abtract class:
- A java class that cannot be instantiated, but that serves as a superclass without defined method bodies. Cannot be instantiated.
- Useful if implementation is different but behavior method call is the same
- NOTE: You can only extend one abstract class, but implement as many interfaces as you want. Do not use abstract class if it isn't the direct superclass of a subclass instead of just promising to implement some shared methods.
- Declare a class abstract by adding the keyword `abstract` to the class header
	- Declar method abstract by putting "abstract" in method header after public
	- An abstract class can have both abstract methods and concrete/"regular" methods

Steps:
1. Design the classes
	- What data is stored?
	- What behaviors need to exist at every level?
	- How should the classes be organized?
2. Start writing the code
	- Check for redundancies
	- Comment the code!
	- Abstract vs interface

I think I found learning about abstract classes and just how to plan for a project useful to use in my own java projects.
