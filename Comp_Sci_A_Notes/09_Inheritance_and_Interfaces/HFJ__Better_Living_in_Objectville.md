HFJ: Better Living in Objectville

- Inheritance allows code reuse between similar classes
	- Indivdual subclasses can still overwrite inherited methods
	- the **subclass extends the superclass**.
- When designing inheritance trees, consider the following:
	- Common attributes?
	- Common behaviors?
	- Overwridden behaviors?
	- Are there subgroups that could inherit a class that then inherits the top superclass?
	- Lowest methods are always called; you can only call a method "above" your class but not above the overridden method

I think this was a good review of how to design an inheritance tree and think about the relationships between classes.
