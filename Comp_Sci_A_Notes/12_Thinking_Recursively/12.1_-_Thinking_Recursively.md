**Iteration**: A programming technique where you describe actions to be repeated in a loop
**Recursion**: A programming technique where you describe actions to be repeated by using a method that calls itself
**Base Case**: A case within a recusive solution that can be solved without using any futher recursive calls.
**Recursive Case**: A case within a recursive solution that reduces the overall problem into something that can be solved with recusion

Example:
- Ask the person in front of you "what place in line are you?", and then they ask the person in front of that, and again, until the person in 1st knows that they are first, and tells that to the person behind them who then in turn tells everyone behind until the final answer is given to you.

```java
public static void writeStars(int n) {
	if (n == 0) {
		// Base Case
		System.out.println();
	} else {
		// Recusrive Case
		System.out.print("*");
		writeStars(n - 1);
	}
}
```
Example run:
```
writeStars(3);
	System.out.print("*");
	writeStars(2);
		System.out.print("*");
		writeStars(1);
			System.out.print("*");
			writeStars(0);
				System.out.println();
```
In the end, we get 3 stars printed.

What I will find useful: I will find the concept of recursion to solve problems such as cell references in TextExcel very useful.
