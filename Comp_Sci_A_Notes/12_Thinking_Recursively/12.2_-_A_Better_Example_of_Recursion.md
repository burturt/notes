- Example: Getting lines from a scanner then replaying the lines in reverse order
```java
public static void reverse(Scanner input) {
	if (input.hasNextLine()) {
		String line = input.nextLine();
		reverse(input);
		System.out.println(line);
	}
}
```
- Attempts to keep printing out the next line, but once there is no last line, the call stack "collapses" with each latest stack layer running the println, which runs in reverse order as it was originally generated, so
**Call Stack:** The internal structure that keeps track of the sequence of methods that have been called, "stacking" new methods called on top of one another and removing the top layer whenever reaching a return statement or the end of a method. Each "stack" has its own set of local variables and can share some global variables among them.
