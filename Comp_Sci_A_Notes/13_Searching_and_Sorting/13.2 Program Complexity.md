13.2 Program Complexity

- Complexity: the computing resources it takes to complete the execution of some code, using time, cpu, memory, or disk space
	- Time Complexity: the time it takes a program to run
		- Empirical Analysis: run the program and time how long it takes to run. Not accurate due to many variables such as speed of computer and other processes running on the computer
		- Algorithm Analysis: Applying mathematic techniques to approximate the time it takes to run a program
#### Example Algorithm Analysis
```java

statement1
statement2
statement3
- length 3
	
	
for (N times) {
	statement1
	statement2
	statement3
}
- length 3N

statement1
for (N times) {
	for (M times) {
		statement2
		statement3
		statement4
	}
}
statement5
statement6
- length 3NM + 3
```

- Generally, as MN grow larger, N becomes insignifigant and is often ignored, so we say "on the order of N^2"
- Loops, especially nested ones, are *expensive* in complexity
	- Avoid nested loops if possible - looping over data finite or constant number of times is almost always better than nested looping

- **Complexity Class**: a set of algorithms that have a similar relationship between input data size and resource consumption

Common Complexity Classese:
- Constant-time or O(1) - algorthms that do not depend on input size
- Logarithmic, or O(log N) - algorithms that divide the problem space in half repeatedly
- Linear, or O(N) - algorithms that process each element of the data individually and double the data = double runtime
- Log-linear or O(N * log N) - algorithms that combine log and linear algorithms. Many efficient sorting algorithms live here
- Quadratic or O(N^2)
- Cubic or O(N^3) - multiply 2 NxN matrices
- Exponential or O(2^n) - finding the powerset of a data. Not efficient and very slow

What I will find useful: I will find useful the discussion of program complexity and making sure to simplify algorithms to minimize the time it takes to run a program and prevent unnessesarily long-running complex programs.
