What do you know about objects?
- Java is an OOP language - objected oriented programming
- Objects help abstract and protect different libraries and program together to help run well together
- Objects have states and behaviors/characteristics 
- Organized collections of data are accessed via reference
- When objects are originally created, a constructor is run
- Classes are the definition of what's in an object and objects are just instances of it in memory with its own attributes and methods
- Call methods and attributes if available using dot notation
- Instance variables and methods can be declared public (accessable outside) or private (not accessable outside object)
- Methods are generally categorized as getters and setters, allowing a client to retrieve and change an object's internal state
- Use the keyword "new" when initializing a new object
- Objects stored in variables are pass-by-reference not by a copy of the object
