2. File/Text manipulation - Linux

## File manipulation
- Viewing files:
	- `cat FILE` - no pagination
	- `less FILE` - pagination
		- up/down arrow keys, page up/down
		- `/TERM` search for a phrase in the file
	- `head FILE`
		- View first 10 lines
	- `tail FILE`
		- View last 10 lines
- Editing files:
	- Many editors exist, common one is `nano`
	- `nano FILE`
		- `^` = control when using commands seen at bottom
		- `CONTROL - X` to exit
- Searching within files:
	- `grep SEARCHTERM PATH`
		- PATH can have wildcards
## Input/Output redirection
- 3 kinds:
	- stdin: input
	- stdout: output
	- stderr: errors
- Redirect stdout to file, do `COMMAND > OUTPUTFILE` to overwrite OUTPUTFILE or `COMMAND >> OUTPUTFILE` to append a line.
- Redirect stdout to stdin of another command: `COMMAND | COMMAND` like `cat words.txt | grep st` or `ls -lah /etc | grep bluetooth`
- Redirect stderr: `COMMAND 2> FILE`
- Input file `COMMAND < INPUTFILE` like `cat < dogs.txt`
- Redirect to `/dev/null` just hides it, like `COMMAND 2> /dev/null`
