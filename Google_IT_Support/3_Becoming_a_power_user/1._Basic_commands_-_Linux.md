1. Basic commands - Linux

## File system
- Root directory: `/`
	- Base of all paths in linux
- All files starting with `.` are hidden
- Listing files:
	- `ls PATH`
		- `ls /`:
			- `/bin` stores essential programs/binaries
			- `/etc` stores config files
			- `/home` stores personal documents
			- `/proc` stores running process info
			- `/usr` user installed programs
			- `/tmp` stores temp files.
		- `ls -l` lists files in a list with extra info like permissions
			- Ex: `drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Oct 5 13:37 bin`
				- `d` = directory, if `-` = file
				- `rwx` permissions for owner, r = read, w = write, x = execute.
				- `r-x` first one, group permissions
				- `r-x` second one, everyone else.
				- `2` number of hard links
				- first `root` user who owns file
				- second `root` group of file
				- `4096` file size
				- `Oct 5 13:37` last modification time
				- `bin` the actual file name
		- `ls -a` lists all files, including hidden ones
		- `ls -h` displays file sizes from -l in a human readable format
- CMD help:
	- `CMD --help` or `CMD -h`
	- `man CMD`
- Changing directory:
	- `cd PATH`
		- Path can be relative, absolute, or use home `~`.
		- `..` goes back one directory, like `../documents`
- Making directories:
	- `mkdir name`
		- If contain invalid chars, use `\` escape char or "quote surrounding"
## History
- `history`
	- Shows history
	- Also can use up/down arrow to move around
- `CONTROL - R`
	- search history
- `clear`
	- Clear screen
## File Manipulation:
- Copy:
	- `cp from_file to_file`
	- Can use wildcards, `cp *.png ~/Pictures` to copy all png files
	- `-r` allows copying directories and contents
- Move:
	- `mv from_file to_file`
	- Same as `cp`, wildcards, `-r`, etc
- Deletion:
	- `rm PATH`
		- `-r` to recurse, delete an entire directory
		- Goes without saying, but **Be careful**
