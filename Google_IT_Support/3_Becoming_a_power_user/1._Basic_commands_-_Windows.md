1. Basic commands - Windows

## File system:
- Path example: `C:\Users\Sam\Desktop`
- File systems assigned to letter drives, like `C:`, `D:`, `X:`, etc
	- Each drive letter is a file system
	- Just that letter + Path separator is the root directory, like `C:\`
- Path separator: `\`
	- Parent + child file format: If `C:\A\B`, a is the "parent" of b
- Listing files:
	- CLI: `ls PATH` i.e. `ls C:\`
- Showing hidden files:
	- GUI: Top --> view, check `hidden items` checkbox
	- `ls -Force PATH`
- View info on file:
	- GUI: right click --> properties
- Command help:
	- CLI: `Get-Help CMD`
- Current directory:
	- `pwd`
		- "Print working directory"
- Changing directory
	- `cd PATH`
		- Path can be relative `..\Documents`, absolute `C:\Users\Sam`, or from home directory `~\Documents`
- Making directory:
	- `mkdir name`
		- if name contains invalid chars like space, surround with `quotes like this` or escape like "try\` this"
# CMD history:
- `history`
	- Shows list of commands run
	- also can scroll between them by using up/down arrows
- `CONTROL - R`
	- Search history for commands
	- Older powershell: prefix with `#` and then tab complete
- `clear`
	- Clear screen
## File manipulation:
- Copying files:
	- GUI:
		- Control - C to copy, Control - V to paste
	- CLI:
		- `cp from_location to_location`
		- can use wildcard `*` like `cp *.txt ~\Documents` to move all .txt files
		- To copy directories, use `-Recurse` and recommened `-Verbose` to say what gets copied
- Moving files:
	- GUI: right click --> rename or drag+drop
	- CLI: `mv from_file to_file`
		- Same as CP, wildcards, `-Recurse`, etc
- Deleting files:
	- GUI: right-click --> delete
		- Goes to recycle bin, not full deletion
	- CLI: `rm path`
		- `-Force` to force remove files if marked as system file but still have permission
		- `-Recurse` to remove an entire directory and files in it
		- Goes without saying, but **Be careful when using this**
