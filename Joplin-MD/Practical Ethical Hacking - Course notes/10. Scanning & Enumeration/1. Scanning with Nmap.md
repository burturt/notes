1. Scanning with Nmap

Finding hosts on connected network:
- `netdiscover`
	- Using ARP requests, finds all hosts on network
	- `-r 192.168.0.0/24` can specify range, may not work on latest kali
- `nmap` aka network mapper
	- Scans for open ports/services
	- "Stealth" scan only does TCP SYN --> SYNACK and then RST, so no full connection is actually created
	- `nmap -T4 -p- -A IP`
		- `-T4` is speed, `-T[1-5]` are all options.
		- `-p-` are ports, `-p-` = all ports, leaving this out scans top 1024 ports. You can go like `-p 80,443`
		- `-A` enables EVERYTHING, including versions, os detection, etc
	- `nmap -sU -T4 -p IP`
		- Scans UDP ports
		- Takes a LOOOOONG time, so only scan top ports
	- Flags:
		- `-sn` just pings everything
		- `-Pn` Treat all hosts as online even if no responce
		- `-sS` TCP scan
		- `-sU` UDP scan
		- `-A` = OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
			- TAKES A LONG TIME WITH `-p`
			- Consider only scanning without `-A`, and then specifying open ports to then do `-A`
