2. Basic meterpreter

Meterpreter is metasploit's equivalent of an upgraded shell that can do hacking-specific things, like turn on camera, quickly get a shell, run exploits fast, migrate to hide the presense of metasploit, and more.

### Basic commands:

Do `help` to see the commands, but the following are ones I use the most:
- `shell` to open a shell to run regular commands. On linux, you will not get a full shell, so you'll have to run a command to get a tty shell or just not have an interactive/tty shell.
- `upload` uploads a file from your computer to the current directory 
- `background` leaves the shell to run other meterpreter commands (see below). Get back using `sessions` then `sessions #`
- `ls` & `cd` work in this shell, combine with the upload/download commands
- `edit` edits a file in vim. See footnote on how to use that
- `getsystem` attempts to get root using a few windows-specific exploits. Warning: may crash the machine!

### Payloads:
- When you use options, you will see the payload listed. You can see all compatible payloads with `show payloads`
- If the exploit fails to run after a few tries, try another payload:
	- Staged vs unstaged: `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_http` vs `windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http`
		- Staged payloads are sent in chunks. This means they are less stable but are compatible with more exploits that may only be able to send smaller chunks of data
		- Unstaged sends the entire payload at once. They are more stable for this reason but may not be as compatible with certain exploits and there aren't many options for unstaged payloads
	- Reverse shell vs bind shell:
		- Reverse shell: The target makes a connection to the attacker. More common and generally can't be "stolen" by others
		- Bind shell: The target opens up a port and waits for a connection by the attacker. Depending on how it is done, the remote connection may be taken by someone else but sometimes a reverse shell won't work so you need a bind shell
	- TCP vs HTTP(S)
		- For our purposes, just try both. From my experience, TCP works better but in the real world, HTTP(S) connections are harder to detect

### Footnote: vim for those who have never used vim
Vim basically has different "modes" you can enter by pressing various keys which is displayed at the bottom of the screen like
`-----INSERT-----`. If you are in any mode, hit escape to exit the mode. 2 modes are of interest:
- `i` or insert mode: Allows editing the file by typing, deleting, etc
- `:` or "vim command" mode (idk the official name). This allows us to tell vim to do stuff, mainly to close and/or save.
	- `:q` quits vim
	- `:w` saves the file
	- `:wq` saves and quits the file
	- `:w!` force saves the file even when vim warns us. Good for files like /etc/sudoers if you aren't using `visudo`
