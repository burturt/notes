2. Basic meterpreter

Meterpreter is metasploit's equivalent of an upgraded shell that can do hacking-specific things, like turn on camera, quickly get a shell, run exploits fast, migrate to hide the presense of metasploit, and more.

### Basic commands:

Do `help` to see the commands, but the following are ones I use the most:
- `shell` to open a shell to run regular commands. On linux, you will not get a full shell, so you'll have to run a command to get a tty shell or just not have an interactive/tty shell.
- `upload` uploads a file from your computer to the current directory 
- `background` leaves the shell to run other meterpreter commands (see below). Get back using `sessions` then `sessions #`
- `ls` & `cd` work in this shell, combine with the upload/download commands
- `edit` edits a file in vim. See footnote on how to use that
- `getsystem` attempts to get root using a few windows-specific exploits. Warning: may crash the machine!

### Footnote: vim for those who have never used vim
Vim basically has different "modes" you can enter by pressing various keys which is displayed at the bottom of the screen like
`-----INSERT-----`. If you are in any mode, hit escape to exit the mode. 2 modes are of interest:
- `i` or insert mode: Allows editing the file by typing, deleting, etc
- `:` or "vim command" mode (idk the official name). This allows us to tell vim to do stuff, mainly to close and/or save.
	- `:q` quits vim
	- `:w` saves the file
	- `:wq` saves and quits the file
	- `:w!` force saves the file even when vim warns us. Good for files like /etc/sudoers if you aren't using `visudo`
