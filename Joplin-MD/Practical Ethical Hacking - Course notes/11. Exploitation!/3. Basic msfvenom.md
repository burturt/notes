3. Basic msfvenom

Msfvenom is a program that allows doing manual metasploit exploitation: you use this tool to generate a payload that when run opens a metasploit session. You can generate many kinds of payloads like php, exe, asp, elf (linux), etc.

### Using msfvenom
msfvenom commands aren't the easiest thing to memorize (unlike nmap which you memorized the `nmap -p- -A -T4 IP`, right?), so I always refer to a cheatsheet. Just search `msfvenom cheatsheet`, but I always use https://nitesculucian.github.io/2018/07/24/msfvenom-cheat-sheet/. Make sure to replace LPORT and LHOST with your computer's host and a port that isn't used (anything over 1000 that you haven't already used will work). Make sure you take note of the payload like `java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp` or `windows/meterpreter/reverse_http`.

### Setting up metasploit
Metasploit provides the `exploit/multi/handler` script in order to use msfvenom. Start up metasploit and use that as your "exploit":
- `msfvenom`
- `use exploit/multi/handler`
- `options`

You might notice that there are no options. That's because we need to tell metasploit which payload to expect, which we can use `set payload PAYLOAD` from the msfvenom file.
Now, when doing `options` you should see a LHOST/LPORT option, which you should use `set` to set. If you are using a vpn, make sure you set LHOST to the proper ip address

Once you have done, just do `run` and it should state listening for payload.
It is now your job to get this executable file to be run on the server you want access and/or as root to get permission elevation.
