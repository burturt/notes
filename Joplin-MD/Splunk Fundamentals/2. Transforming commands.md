2. Transforming commands

### Definition: Order search results into a data table for statistical purposes
### top
- `top FIELD1 FIELD2`
- Finds most common fields, returns count and percent fields, default `limit=10`
	- limit=0 returns all fields
- Other clauses:
	- countfield = string
	- percentfield = string
	- showcount = True/False
	- showperc = True/False
	- showother = True/False
	- otherstr = string, default "OTHER"
	- Last 2 are to add a row for those that don't make the limit
- `by` clause:
	- Runs top for every kind of FIELD1
	- i.e. `top product_name by Vendor limit=3` where 1 record is one sale, this shows top 3 products for each vendor.
### rare
- Same as top, but shows least rare
### stats
- Common functions, all work on a field:
	- count
		- Counts number of events that satisfy requirements
		- `stats count as "Total sales" by product_name, categoryId, sale_price` returns list of product names and counts under "Total sales" field.
		- Adding argument to count counts only events with that field
			- `stats count(action) as ActionEvents` = only count events with action
			- `stats count(action) as ActionEvents, count as "Total Events"` shows both count of ones with action and in general all of them
	- dc
		- Counts number of unique values that satisfy requirements
		- Works same as count
	- sum
		- Adds numerical values
		- `stats sum(price) as "Gross Sales" by product_name` shows total sales by product_name
		- `stats count as "Units Sold" sum(price) as "Gross Sales" by product_name` shows both count as Units Sold and total sales as Gross sales for each product_name.
			- for above example, sum and count **must be in same pipe section!**
	- avg
		- Returns average numerical value
		- `stats avg(sale_price) as "Average Price by categoryId"
			- Missing/misformatted values are not included
	- min
		- Min numerical value
		- Works like avg
	- max
		- Maximum numerical values
		- works like avg
	- list
		- list all values of a field
		- `stats list(Asset) as "comany assets" by Employee` shows all Assets that each Employee has
	- values
		- list all unique values of a field
		- Works like list
