README

Hello! Welcome to my notes for the THM KoTH boxes.

These notes were originally written with me referencing them in mind and not for anyone to look at, but it should be easy enough to figure out what I'm trying to say.

I have included all attack vectors I know of on these boxes and ways to stop others from exploiting the same thing. A couple of the boxes also have writeups by their creator which I've also linked. I have striven to have 2 shell routes and list all SUID/sudo routes from these shell routes per box.

If you feel like any of my notes are overly vague, don't be afraid to ask me questions about them!

I highly recommend reading the practical ethical hacking exploitation metasploit notes and (in progress) the reverse shell note before attempting to read these writeups.
