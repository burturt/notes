1. Making a clean slate for pull requests

- On github, click fork
- `git clone FORK`
- `git checkout -b patch-NAME`
- make changes, `git add FILE`, `git commit`, `git status`, etc
- `git remote add upstream FORKED` where FORKED is the git clone url for the original repo that was forked
- `git fetch upstream`
- `git rebase upstream/master`
- use `git log` to verify
- `git push origin`
- make pull request within github's GUI

Notes:
- `git pull upstream master` then `git commit` to update from the forked git
	- These commits will disappear when you use rebase at the end
- Remember to `git push origin` reguarily and fetch/merge/rebase off of the upstream often to make conflicts more rare and easier to fix

__**DO NOT REBASE ON NON-PULL-REQUEST REPOS/BRANCHES, THIS WILL SCREW STUFF UP**__
