- Robinson - won Model City
- Police Chief
- Election Board
- First vote: system slow, so we had a super organized second vote, getting the nominations in
	- Issue with "overnominations" - esp. SCOTUS Judges, there was only a single candidate from Grimsley county, and they got *pummelled* with nominations, and literally the entire nomination filing period was him going around to campaign to remove nomination signatures on his petition
- Rush to fill out forms 
- Bar exam: I passed the bar exam, and my city had 32/39 pass on an exam that has about a 50% cutoff on the curve
	- Turns out they made a mistake and messed up the curve, and they ended up revoking some of the bar exam things but 

- We were generally law-abiding to the max, so our counselor literally sat down with us and said "you have to *do* something, and I'm giving you permission to go wild"
- This is boys state, not counselor's state
- Sons of Garrett (counselor)
- Police Citations:
	- Booked like 10 people for not having proper slack name formats
	- Charged some people for posting twice and not paying
