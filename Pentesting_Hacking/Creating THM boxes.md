Creating THM boxes

1. MAKE SURE THE VERSION OF LINUX YOU ARE USING IS ACCEPTED BY THM. AS OF THIS MESSAGE, DEBIAN 9+ IS NOT SUPPORTED
2. Once you have added all users, do `for i in $(ls /home); do cd /home/$i; ln -sf /dev/null .bash_history; done`
3. Once you are 100% done, wipe logs with `find /var/log -type f -delete`
4. If you want to work on the machine via interactive shell, make sure to install ssh server.
5. Make sure the machine just works after a reboot
6. Export as OVF --> either select the OVA option, or if there isn't one, manually rename the output filename to .ova instead
