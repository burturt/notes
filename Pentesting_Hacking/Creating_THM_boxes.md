Creating THM boxes

1. **MAKE SURE THE VERSION OF LINUX YOU ARE USING IS ACCEPTED BY THM. AS OF THIS MESSAGE, DEBIAN 9+/UBUNTU 20.04+ IS NOT SUPPORTED** (as of me writing this). Download the server iso and install it w/o gui but with ssh server using Legacy BIOS, set rootsudo password to something secure. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmie_prereqs.html. I've personally been using Ubuntu 18.04 w/ 10GB virtual disk size
2. Once you have added all users, do `for i in $(ls /home); do cd /home/$i; ln -sf /dev/null .bash_history; done` and `ln -sf /dev/null /root/.bash_history`
3. Once you are 100% done, wipe logs with `find /var/log -type f -delete`
4. Make sure the machine just works after a reboot WITHOUT internet access. systemctl, `@reboot` cron, and `init.d` scripts all work. Avoid docker if possible.
5. Export as OVF --> either select the OVA option, or if there isn't one, manually rename the output filename to .ova instead and vmware/virtual box will automatically export as ova
6. Upload and test USING A FREE ACCOUNT and put a disclaimer on the room for how long the box will take to boot.
