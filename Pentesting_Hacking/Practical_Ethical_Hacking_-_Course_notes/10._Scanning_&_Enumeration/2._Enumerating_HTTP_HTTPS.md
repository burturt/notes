2. Enumerating HTTP/HTTPS

- If you see an open port 80/443/web server, just view it in web browser first
	- Make sure to deactivate burp proxy if that's enabled
- Default page?
	- Hidden pages in directories? See directory busting.
	- Hygene? Not very secure to just open a web site with default page, what else are they doing?
- Not default?
	- View source code for:
		- keys, passwords, etc
		- info about servers
### Nikto
- Does vulnerability scanning against the website
- `nikto -h URL`

### Directory busting
- `gobuster` `dirb` `dirbuster` are all possible tools, this one is dirbuster
- `dirbuster&` opens a GUI
	- Set Target URL
		- Incluide the port and http(s)://!
	- Wordlists are found in `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster`
		- Start with small, maybe move to medium if small doesn't get anything
		- Use appropriate extensions to web server,
			- apache = php
			- windows = asp,aspx
			- also might add .txt

### BurpSuite testing
- Setup burp
- In proxy tab, right click --> send to repeater to make changes and edit stuff to resend and see responces, etc
	- Forward to let it go through, can also toggle to stop intercepting requests
- In Target tab, it shows list of all requests and responses made
	- In target --> scope tab, you can set the in/out of scope to only see stuff from certain websites
