- Port forwarding is accomplished with the -L switch, which creates a link to a Local port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:
`ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`
We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 on our own attacking machine. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. 

- Proxies are made using the -D switch, for example: -D 1337. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:
`ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`
Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.

- Reverse connection: `ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN`
