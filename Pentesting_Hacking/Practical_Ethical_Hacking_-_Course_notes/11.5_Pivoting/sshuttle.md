- Base command to connect: `sshuttle -r username@address subnet` i.e. `sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24`
	- Instead of subnet, try `-N` to automatically determine the subnet
	- Add `&` to background
- How to use key-based authentication:
	- `--ssh-cmd` allows specifying ssh command
	- E.g. `sshuttle -r user@address --ssh-cmd "ssh -i KEYFILE" SUBNET`

```client: Connected.
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
client: fatal: server died with error code 255
```
- If you get above error, that means connection ip is the same as subnet. Exclude connection ip with `-x PIVOT_IP`
