1. Setting up the THM VM

Commands I run when getting a fresh kali instance, mainly for the web (or RDP) VM that tryhackme uses.

`apt update`

`apt install fcrackzip`

`gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`

`wget https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.31.0-defconfig-multiarch-musl/busybox-x86_64 -O busybox` for a chattr binary that you can transfer to a box.
