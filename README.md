# notes
A collection of my notes in joplin. Feel free to use them as a reference/add to your own notes, but please do not claim them as yours. The joplin MD directory shows as Markdown files, the html directory is formatted as html. Pick whichever one you like better, though note that html will not show in github. download the app from https://joplinapp.org/
