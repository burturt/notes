# notes
A collection of my notes in joplin. Feel free to use them as a reference/add to your own notes, no guarentee on accuracy is given though I can guarentee they are the notes I use/used. All notes are in Markdown.

Note: Joplin's MD and GitHub's MD engine are different, so the notes may not be 100% formatted nicely, though I've tried to keep in mind the fact that these notes will be seen in github. D
