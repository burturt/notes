1. SPL fundamentals

## Basic search bar stuff:
- AND, OR, NOT are valid terms
- Implied AND between words, include spaces with quotes
- fields listed on left side can be specified with FIELD=SEARCH, where field is case sensitive but values are not and = can be any operator.
	- Operators: 
		- `=` and `!=` for numerical or string values
		- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` for numerical values
	- Selected fields are what show up, can be added by selecting field and turning on selected fields
	- Interesting fields show up in at least 20% of fields
## SPL: fields command
- `fields [-] LIST`
	- `-` removes fields as blacklist instead of whitelist
	- i.e. `fields - status clientip` removes status and clientip fields from further searching or `fields pid clientip host` only makes available pid, clientip, and host fields to future searches.
	- Internal fields like raw and time fields are always there, removing it just hides it from viewing
	- Field extraction is one of the most costly parts of splunk
		- Field inclusing happens before extracting info, which means better performance
		- Field exclusion still has all fields extracted, so no real performance change
## SPL: table
- `table FIELDS` where FIELDS is comma delimited
	- i.e. `table JSESSIONID, product_name, price`
	- Same syntax as fields
## SPL: rename
- `rename OLDNAME as NEWNAME OLDNAME2 as NEWNAME2`
	- i.e. `rename JSESSIONID as "User Session" product_name as "Product"`
	- Wrap name in quotes if spaces
## SPL: dedup
- `dedup FIELD1 FIELD2 ...`
	- Removes duplicate entries where all the field(s) listed are the same on comparison
	- i.e. `dedup First_name Last_name` will only show people once when for instance piping to a table
## SPL: sort
- `sort [+-] FIELD1 FIELD2...`
	- Sort field by FIELD1 first, then FIELD2 if FIELD! is same, etc
	- String data is sorted alphanumerically, numeric data is sorted numerically
	- for [+-], + is ascending order (default/implied), - is decending order.
		- This can go with a space separating to apply to all fields or can be "attached" to a field like `sort -sale_price Vendor` to only sort that field in decending order by vendor is still ascending order
	- `sort FIELD_STUFF limit=X` limits to X events being displayed
