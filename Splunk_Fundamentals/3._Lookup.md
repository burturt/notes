3._Lookup

3. Lookup

### Setup:
1. Define lookup table
2. Define lookup 

optionally configure to run automatically, fields are case sensitive.

Step 1: define lookup table
1. Get csv (usually) file with a field that "matches" another field in the data
2. Settings --> lookups --> Lookup table files with "add new" button
3. Upload and name
4. Change permissions or move/delete it from this table
5. Verify lookup by doing `| inputlookup FILENAME`

Step 2: define lookup
1. Settings --> lookups --> lookup definitions "add new"
2. Choose desination app and name as well as base file and file type
	- Time-based lookup if time field in lookup table

## Lookup command:
`index=web sourcetype=access_combined NOT status=200 | lookup http_status code as status` where http_status is name of lookup and code is field you are matching on.
- in this case, we are using the code field in the lookup table to "link" with the existing status field and then pull all other rows in the lookup table using this link
- `OUTPUT code as "HTTP CODE", description as "HTTP Description"` renames the fields in the lookup table. By default, "code" is normally not an output field unless defined here
	- `OUTPUTNEW` does not overwrite existing fields

## Automatic lookup:
1. Settings --> Lookups
2. Automatic lookups
