- Von Neumann model: processor fetches instruction from memory, decodes it, then executes it
- role of OS:
	- Resource manager: managing physical resources and virtualizing them (cpu multithreading, memory)
	- Virtualized memory - virtual address space
- Multiprogramming
	- load and switch between jobs rapidly
