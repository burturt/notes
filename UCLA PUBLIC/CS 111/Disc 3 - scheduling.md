## Key Metrics
- Fairness
- Waiting time
	- Total time waiting
- Reponse time
	- Time until first execution of process
- CPU utilization
- Throughput
## Common approaches
- First come first serve
	- Easy to implement
	- Minimze context switching
	- Increased waiting time
	- Does not work well with timed sharing systems (e.g. listening to music in the background)
	- Unfair scheduling
- Shortest job first
	- Increased throughput
	- Minimize average waiting time
	- Minimze context switching
	- Impossible to predict future
	- Starvation for long processes
	- Not preemptive
- Shortest remaining time first/shortest time to completion
 	- Increased throughput
	- Minimize average waiting time
	- More context switching than SJF
	- Impossible to predict future
	- Starvation for long processes
	- Preemptive
- Round Robin
	- Divide time into time slices, and cycle between processes depending on set quantum length (QL)
	- Fair/minimize starvation
	- Low average response time
	- Does not require burst time estimation/guessing
	- Performance dependent on QL
	- No sense of priority between tasks
