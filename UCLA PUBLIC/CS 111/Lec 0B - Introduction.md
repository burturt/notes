## intro: dd command
- k = 10^3 = 2^10
- M = 10^6 = 2^20
- G = 10^9 = 2^30
- T = 10^12 = 2^40
- `dd obs=1M seek=7T of=big`
	- obs: output block size of 1 MiB = 2^20 bytes
	- seek: skip ahead 7 * 2^40 blocks, or 7 * 2^40* 2^20 bytes before writing data from stdin
	- of: output file
- `cat` this large file: takes a very long time
- `grep` the file: almost instant
- `truss` - `strace` alternative
	- What is the `strace` unable to open /dev/log?
	- `llseek(3, ###, SEEK_DATA)`: returns next location with data
