- **CAP Theorem**:
	- Consistency (every read receives most recent write), availability, and partition tolerance (if messages lost or delayed by network) can't all be satisfied in distributed system when a network partition or failure occurs
	- Partition tolerance must always be true
- Key-value, columnar (each row can have different number of columns, adding columns is simple), document store, graph
- Columnar:
	- Each row key has keyspace of key-value pairs of columns
	- unnormalized for fast lookups
	- usable as Data Warehouse
	- Rows are strictly ordered
	- No joins - it's not relational
- MongoDB:
	- Each record is a document, stored in BSON
	- Records organized into collections, which are organized into databases
	- Use `db.coolection.find()`
	- Lots of redundancy, no normalization
	- No joins
	- No schema (BSON blobs)
