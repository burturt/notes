- Reflection (introspection): program that is running that can change how it runs
- Application Frameworks: set of libraries, modules, packages, etc + a development philosophy (and often tools) to help build apps efficiently
- Collaborative development: git (orig linux kernel)
	- Look at it as a user and internals
### Topics:
- file systems
	- Data stored on secondary persistent storage
- Scripting
	- "Quick and dirty" programming
	- different attitude: unpolished, quickly-written code, but maintainable
- Building/distribution
	- Developer --> user running code distribution chain
- Version control ("configuration management")
	- manage different versions, for devs and users
- low level construction (fixing bugs)
- client-server code
	- programs that run on 2 computers at the same time
#### Glossed-over topics
- Programming data design
- Integration (combining software together)
- Configuration
	- Main source of friction and causes lots of problems
- Testing
- Forensics
	- figuring out what went wrong and why in a program
## Suggestions:
- Print out HWs
# Basics
- OS:
	- kernel, core of operating system, exists in restricted kernel space
		- Walls off the hardware from direct access
	- application processes
- Levels of program:
	- Hardware --> (machine instructions --> register changes) --> kernel --> (system calls (look like function calls)) --> modules (C library usually + others) --> applications
	- Apps can do almost everything in unrestricted area, with a little bit of kernel-restricted actions via C library
	- Apps memory are restricted and partially isolated
## Shell
- Command language (scripting language)
	- Designed to be run interactively but can be scriped in files
	- shell "spawns" processes and has some control over it, waits until it has finished
	- "shell" is supposed to be simple, like a shell, and sits between users and programs
- Exiting commands:
	- `control-D`: means end of file (if at start of line)
	- `control-C`: interrupt the current process
- `cat`: (concatenate) returns text you give it or reads files if given as argument
- `ps`: (process status) show processes
	- `ps -e`: lists *everything*
- `less`: interactively control display of large amounts of data
	- "read-only text editor"
	- Control: cursor movement
	- `/search term` return
- `|` pipe: take output of before command and make it the input of the next command 
- `od`: octal dump
	- `-t` format display; c for character, x1 for hex
