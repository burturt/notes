- B = Breakfast (7-10), L = Lunch (11-3), D = Dinner (5-9), ED = Extended Dinner (9pm - midnight)
- Bold dining halls are my personal recommendation list

## Dining Halls in order of distance from my dorm:

- **De Neve**: What you think of when someone talks about a stereotypical college dining hall, but better (this is where most of my summer food pictures are from). Usually my default due to proximity to my dorm and soft serve. Has gourmet salad bar (tofu, shrimp, corn, bacon, eggs, salmon, turkey, etc). Open B/L/D, but closes earlier than most other dining locations for B/L.
    - Technically open ED but as a takeout only offering a couple burgers or chicken tenders, all comparable to fast food. Nothing fancy
- Bruin Plate ("B Plate"): Healthy everything. Sometimes they do things really well (their chicken the last couple of times I went was AMAZING), but sometimes it can be a bit out there. Open B/L/D
- **Epic at Covel**: Dinner only; decent-to-amazing Italian/Mediterranean food, and is where most pictures I've taken after summer come from. Lines often long.

Despite what UCLA Housing posts, they do allow swiping in other people. As long as you are fine being out of place I can get you in.

## Take-out in order of distance from my dorm:

- **BCafe** ("b-caf"): Lots of sandwiches, all of which are really good. Open weekdays L/D, closes early L.
- Feast: Originally a regular dining hall, it's really now just a food truck that's moved into the dining hall. D/ED weekdays
- **Rendezvous** ("Rende"): West is mexican build-your-own burrito/bowl/tacos or daily special and salsa bar. Very good, almost always long lines. East is discount panda express with comparatively less options. Also has a boba station which apparently isn't that good. L/D
- The Study: Build your own breakfast sandwich or eggs (B), pizza, salad, or sandwich (L/D/ED). Lines can get long, but it allows you to do almost anything. Want a pizza with pesto, vegan cheese, salmon, ranch, pineapple, and basil? Go right ahead!
- The Drey: Never been there, can't comment, supposedly it's decent but not that great in comparison to other dining options. Has wide variety of grab-and-go options, including sandwiches, salads, sushi, and bento boxes. weekdays L/D, closes early
- **Epic at Ackerman**: Limited selection compared to a normal place, but has some *really* good options, I would argue best food on campus excluding the hill, and as long as you don't get bored of the selection, better than the other Epic at Covel imo. Long lines around lunch hour because it's the only place that takes swipes directly. Located at Ackerman Union, open weekdays L/D.

There's also 3-6 food trucks available L/D/ED, varying from full entr√©es to large sides (e.g buffalo wings) to desserts. They ONLY take swipes while on the hill, no cash/credit card/whatever accepted. Details on which truck is available when is on the hours tab of the menu website, but menus of the trucks themselves are not posted - it's usually a small subset of their normal offerings.
