- Climate: temperate except okinawa
	- Hokkaido is sometimes not teperate
- Geography: intersection of 4 tectonic plates
	- LOTS of earthquakes
	- Short time when japan was connected by land bridges to Korea and to Hokkaido
# Paleolithic
(Pre-ceramic/"stone age")
- 32000-13000 years ago
- Very little known about this period:
	- Most archelogical sites are now under water due to ice age ending
	- First "evidence" (stone tool) was about 35000 years ago
- Lived in rock shelters and caves (no evidence of building anything)
- **Ground/polished** stone tools
	- Unusual to Japan
	- No evidence of decorated tools, no "culture" evidence
- Hunting and gathering:
	- Hunted large animals
		- Nauman's elephant
		- Giant deer
		- Mammoth
# Jomon
- Roughly 12000 - 4000 BCE
- Gradual transition
- Culture: symbols, signs, shapes, patterns, etc
	- "What does this design represent?"
- **Appearance of Pottery**
	- One of the most elaborate for its time
	- Jomon means "rope pattern"
		- Often (but not always) rolled a cord to make layered rope-like shapes in pots
- Hunter-gatherer societes
- Limited agriculture
	- Small things, not much grown
	- Did not really grow a lot despite having pots
	- limited: soybeans
- Not much structure or outside contact that we know of
- Period ends with full-scale agriculture (wet-rice farming)
## Jomon Tech
- Pottery use:
	- Food preservation, cooking
	- Salt production: use for trade and preservation
	- Trade item from coast to inland
	- Ability to store food or items
	- Allows for human culture to develop
- Hunting
	- Traps, used hunting tools in communities (specialization), arrows
	- hunted boar, deer, fish
		- Fishing: Needles, hooks, harpoons 
- Settlements
	- Multiple household buildings
	- storage building
	- sometimes communal buildings
	- Pit houses
- Population growth
	- 22000 in 6000 to 260000 2500
	- NOT linear growth
## Pottery
- Pottery as technology: functional use
- Pottery as Representation: cultural meaning
	- Decoration: people, animals, elements, symbols, etc
	- Make people feel things: community, belonging, ancenstors, etc
- Dogu: clay human figures
	- Mostly female
	- Various positions: praying, heart shaped, goggle, etc
	- Maybe ritual use?
	- Anthropologists will make assumptions, but we can never know for sure
	- Sometimes broke off arm or leg
# Yayoi
- 900-400 BCE or earlier to 200 CE
- Must have come from the mainland continent and mixed with Jomon to create new culture
- Brought iron, bronze, cloth, wood, glass
	- All originally imported
- New farming technology
	- wet-rice agriculture
- Came from Korea and moved North
## Yayoi tech
- Plant cultivation
	- Dry cultivation (millet, barlet, wheat, etc)
	- Wet-rice agriculture
- Pots: technically more advanced (can do more) but less design and variation compared to Jomon pots
## Yayoi Society
- Increasingly hirearchical
- Evidence of warfare (weapons, fortifiactions, signs of violence in skeletal remains)
- Emergence of political units
- Contact with Korean peninsula, appearance in Chinese records
- Tombs: lots of precious objects
	- Swords, mirrors, etc
	- From this, we assume more hirearchial structure
- New materials: bronze
	- Made ritual bells
	- Not practical: can't ring
	- Often buried away from settlement in large stashes
	- Bronze Bells with hunting scenes: kings hunt the animals
		- Symbolically represent authority
- Also found symbols in tombs:
	- Priestess buried in large burial jars
		- Found bracelets across entire arm
		- Mirror found made in China: 
### China during this time:
- Han Dynesty: very advanced society
	- Gave item that stated recognized king to Japan
	- Beginning of writing: inscriptions on items important from China
		- Knew markings meant power and importance but couldn't understand
	- Record of Kimiko
# Tomb period
- Writing and contact with Chinese Dynasties 
	- Regular embassies going back and forth
