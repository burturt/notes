# Key points:
- Loss of power of retired emperors
- System of dual government
- Two legal tribunals (kyoto and kamakura)
	- Shogunate issues legal codes: impose layer on estates on top of imperial government code
- Kamakura control of provinces
	- Appoints Stewards and Military governors
- Mongol invasions
	- At first allowed kamakura shogunate to extend influence into western japan
	- Weakened shogunate, could not reward warriors who stopped invasion
- Emperor is still there, but much weaker and power is limited to around Heian capital
	- Kamakura controls more and more of rest of japan
	- Kamakura puppet shogun and established offices in response to issues, ad hoc structure that grows as needed
	- Kamakura court relies on imperial court for legitimacy: removal of imperial court would face a lot of opposition
## Shoen system
- In heian period: imperial court appointed provisional government to oversee estates
- In kamakura period: shogunate appointed military governor to protect, and steward to administrate and collect taxes/rent
	- Kamakura now collecting taxes from many estates not near Heian!
- Both imperial and bakufu system co-exist until imperial system gradually disappears
