Describe (in 500-700 words) how various different ideologies of imperial conquest, expansion, and authority shaped and influenced political developments in sixteenth century Japan. Make sure you discuss 1) the competition for “all under heaven” and the “three unifiers” in Japan 2) the Jesuit presence in Japan, and 3) Hideyoshi’s attempted invasion of Korea, and how each of these might relate to each other. As always, look for connections among culture/ideology (including religion), economics/trade, legal reform, and politics. (It will be difficult to attempt this question without hearing both of this week’s lectures).
