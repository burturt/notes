## Late Tokugawa Ideology
- printing and literacy allows knowledge to spread to many

- Merchant ideas of utility and economic relations
	- Neo-confucian concepts re-interpreted in economic terms
	- ideal society:
		- Ruled by small group of elites, people work the agriculture fields and make money for themselves and funds samurai stipends
		- Tokugawa looked down on merchants as not actually doing anything, just directly turning a profit
	- Economic problems: merchants scapegoated when problems occur since "we need to go back to golden age" of ideal society
	- Some merchants do well, educated, etc, so they see themselves as a social group that contribute towards society
		- warriors keep peace, farmers grow food, merchants trade to the benefit of individuals and society (no trade = suffering)
- Dutch Learning and Western Science
	- Dutch Learning: any knowledge that comes from europe (e.g. electricity, anatomy, medical knowledge)
- "Studdy of ancient meaning"
	- Challenge to Neo-Confucian Tokugawa orthodoxy
	- Instead of relying on teachers and interpreitations, some go to the source with woodblock printing
	- Why study China? Let's study japan
	- public debate about what is important
- Nativist learning, Shinto Revivalists
- Sonno Joi
	- Revere the sovereign and expel the barbarians
- idealization of a strong samurai class: samurai are out of practice
