## What is Public Opinion?
- Public opinion is "Those opinions held by private perons which governments find it prudent to heed"
- Always been a political force, even before US
- Leaders try to mold public opinion (speeches, writings, etc) and then serve as agents for political expression
- Scientific Polling: polling to systematically investigate opinions of ordinary people randomly
## Measuring Public Opinion
- Basic techniques: randomly sample people, more people = less error
	- Truely random samples are difficult to obtain due to bias with sampling
	- Even full population sampling doesn't work, since people answer differently, lie, don't understand or refuse to answer
		- Measurement error occurs
- President often tries to measure
- Public opinion polls help citizens to act collectively
	- Allow coordination unintentionally
## The Origins of Public Opinion
- Public opinion attracts attention due to effect on political behavior (voting)
#### Attitudes
- Attitude: organized and consistent manner of thinking, feeling, and reacting with regards to others and the enviornment
	- May involve feelings
	- e.g. "I trust the Democratic party", "The Democrats are for gun control"
	- Vary widely from individual to individual
#### Ideologies
- Organized sets of political attitudes
	- Connected to something greater, some general principle or set of principles
- Liberals vs Conservatives
- People hold core values
	- People usually unaware of inconsistencies, e.g. dislikes "big government" but wants stricter consumer protection
#### Partisanship
- Party identity can become a part of a person's identity or just a shorthand cue
	- rarely party changes
	- People find their party procudes preferred results more than the other
- Party identification affects underlying beliefs and introduces bias
#### Acquiring Opinions
- Political Socialization: process of acquiring political attitudes, especially during childhoold/young adulthood
	- New experiences
#### Information
- People only develop more complex, informed attitudes only when payoff is worth the cost
	- Most don't live in high-political settings, so often rely on group cues from parites or other groups to express opinions
- Ignorance causes uninformed opinions which are unstable
- Unstable opinions means slight wording can influence responses in polls
#### Framing
- Way an issue is presented
- ambivalence: response to question depends on which considerations come to mind first
- Media can affect expressed political opinions through framing: forcefully draw out one response over another
## Is Public Opinion Meaningful?
- Yes: while individual opnions are badly informed and unstable, **aggregate public opinion** is stable and coherent
#### Stability of Aggregate Public Opinion
- In general, belief is generally consistent unless there is a changed condition or historical trends
- Constant "mood" swings between liberal and conservative
- **Aggregate partisanship**: porportion of poll responders labeling themselves on party affects presidential approval
	- Shifts with changes in political enviornment, economic conditions, international events, and presidential approval
#### Opinion Leadership
- Measurement errors cancel when survey responses are added together
- Only small segment pay attention, rest free ride
- Opinion leaders are the attentive publics
- Cognitive Shortcuts: shortcut doing the work of making complex choices
- issue publics: subsets of population about an issue that care, e.g. farmers on farm programs
	- Most issues fall here
## The Content of Public Opinion
- Political opinions reflect people's values and beliefs about the world
- Generally people share a broad consensus on basic values, but disagree on details
	- Allows collective action to occur
#### Opinions on the system
- Basics are agreed upon but not speicalization, like whether free speech extends to terrorist sympathizers
	- Most support captialism, yet democracy (equalization) and capitalism (favor the upper tiers) are not fully compatible
- Generally overwhemingly favor US political system, but not so much about actual elected people
#### Opinions on Issues
- Economic: business regulaion supported, generally increasing over time
	- Large programs support universal benefit programs
- Social/Cultural/Moral issues: often super decisive but based on how the policy is framed changes results, not public support (e.g. abortion)
	- Americans generally going more liberal
- Foreign Policy: many don't pay attention due to little daily effect
	- When there is, often falls across party lines, direct effect on constituents, etc
## Effects of Background on Public Opinion
- Electorate divided by race/ethnicity, education, gender, age, and religion to show coorlation to the parties
- Divide on police by race and discrimination in general
	- Shared sense of experience
- Large gender gap by party
- Income gap:
	- economic self-interest has that income groups want funding in their benefit area
- Education: varying level of support
- Religion: religious beliefs shape psychological attachments and values, often then used to attempt to achieve something throuhg politics
- Other divides: younger vs older voters, city dwellers vs subers, small towns, rural areas, coasts vs South
## Summary
- Many orgs trying to measure or influence politics, but super complex
	- Publics influence is NOT simple and changes over time
- Mass media and opinion leaders can help shape opinions, but they do not control public opinion
	- People choose leaders to follow
