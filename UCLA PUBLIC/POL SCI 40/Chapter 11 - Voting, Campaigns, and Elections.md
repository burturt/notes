## Logic of Elections
- Republic: citizens delegate power and government to a small number of citizens
	- Size of US prevents direct democracy
	- Need to trust others to do the right thing
	- Risks individuals putting own interests ahead of public interest
	- Elections help solve the delegation selection problem
## Right to Vote
- Originally had property qualifications, must be men and some had religious requirements
- Moved to wider suffrage: "no taxation without representation" as many men contributed to rev war
- Suffrage for women: because women were expected to vote for "family values"
- African Americans/Young Americans: 26th amendment for young in relation to Vietnam War
## Who Uses the right to vote?
- Many don't actually vote
	- Collective action problem: free riding from not voting yet benefit from others voting and one vote is not going to swing any election
- Individual factors affecting turnout
	- Age, race, education highest influence
	- Deeper connection = more likely to vote
	- People who vote must meet the costs but appreciate/understand the benefits
- Institutional Factors
	- Voter registration requirements/barrier to vote
	- Social circumstances: seeing other vote or being directly asked
		- Personal appeals
- How do voters decide?
	- Past performance and incumbency
		- look at performance of incumbents, esp prez, like looking at economy
	- Assessing issues and policy options
		- Looking at own lives by looking at SS check sizes
	- Single issue voters
		- Voting on a single issue that is important
- Voter Cues and Shortcuts
	- Opinion leaders
	- Personal criteria are used: honestly, etc
	- Party labels: give some idea on how a candidate stands on an issue
		- Performance voting (voting for/against in-office party based on performance) and issue voting (voting on how Rep/Dem differ predictably in issues)
- The Power of Party Identification
	- Party loyalty predicts elections, independents split
	- Weaker party identification = more likely to vote for minor party candidate
## Election Campaigns
- Campaigns abuse fact that voters free ride on info 
	- Must adapt to circumstances, changes a lot
- Candidate: person who can portray themselves to the public as able and qualified for the job
	- Parties nominate candidates through primaries
- Message: answering "why vote for me"
	- Chosen opportunistically
	- Slogan is part of message, but more than just slogal
- Connecting to voters: "I'm just like you!"
	- sometimes works, sometimes doesn't
- Getting attention
	- **campaign gaffs**: political mistakes
	- Candidates fight for attention due to early primaries
	- Televised debates
		- Challenge candidates to convey message under pressure
		- Unavoidable for top candidates
- Advertising and Attacks
	- Effect of ads are small: must keep up advertising to keep any effect
	- Many ads near election day
	- Attempt to mislead by combining elements
	- **Negative or Attack Campaigning:**
		- Can be ugly but effective
		- People hate it, but little pushback
		- Target rationally ignorant, marginally involved voters
		- Campaigns must quickly and effectively respond to such attacks
	- Goal is to win a majority of votes, not every vote
## Money in Campaigns
- Orig controlled by newspapers and party organizations, but now television and online media
- Costs continue to grow
- Regulation:
	- All funding is private
	- Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971: required public reporting of funding sources and spending caps
		- Cap later struck down if funds are 100% private
	- "Soft money": money not regulated by FECA
- Flow of campaign money:
	- Costs continue to grpw
	- Huge variation in campaign budgets
	- Funds required in primaries to beat out other same-party candidates OR beating incubents
		- Incubents more spend = less likely to win due to spending 			- feeling threatened
- Difficult to connect funds to voting: is money given actually for campaign or because they vote the same way?
- Funds spent:
	- Huge chunk in advertising
	- Other funds still important like debates and travel and staff overhead
- Presidential Campaigning:
	- Spend in "swing states" because of winner-take-all system
## Logic of Elections Revised
- Candidates can win plurality of popular vote but not electoral college
- Electoral college

# Research paper
### 2010
- Voter's well-being sense from college football wins = better chances for incubent
- College football wins have zero influence: no one expects government to have any effect on this unlike natural disasters for example
- First study President, Governor, and senate elections over about 40 years
	- Wins in the days before election causes higher percentage for incubent, even when trying to compare turnout
- Second survey:
	- Increased approval in march madness when their team won, 
## 2015
- Asserts original research paper followed all convention but just was unlucky to happen to have result
	- Disprove by showing results of other analysis
- First looks at college football:
	- Found same advantage result
	- When Split ticket incubent Senate and gov, no advantage found
- Inverse effect found in higher interest teams
- NFL has no similar effect
