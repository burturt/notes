- Intro:
	- Interest groups claim to represent people
	- They also can fund campaigns and attempt to get policies pushed, but while money talks, it is not the end-all of winning as careful campaining and influence pushing wins over just spending money
	- Orgonized interest groups are inevitable in our political system
# The Logic of Lobbying
- Lobbying: appeals from citizens and groups for favorable policies and decisions
	- Government welcomes them as they need information from them and
- Elected officials understand the power of support of the governed
	- Accomodate those who command valuable electoral resources
- lobbyists: professionals hired to lobby & represent an interest group
# Origins of Interest Group Politics in the US
- Federalist 10/Madison: Factions were a thret to populat government
	- Factions couldn't be removed without limiting rights, "worse than the disease"
- Factions existed since Colonial era:
	- Merchants, manufactures, ethnic/religious minorities attempted to get policies from London
		- Organized letter writing, hired lobbyists
		- **public interest lobby**: appealing to the general public for support
- Factions flourished after Rev War
#### Pluralist Defense of Interest Groups
- David Truman *The Governmental Process*: defense of political interest groups as natural and benign consequence
- Groups are free to organize
- If groups organized policies threatening the citizens, those citizens would organize their own group
- reality: some groups are overrepresented
#### Problem of Collective Action
- Another explanation: takes work to coordinate, get resources, and continue
	- Groups must overcome free riding issue
	- Smaller & better funded are more likely to succeed: more pressure to counter free riding
- Group size and stakes are often inversely related
- Some groups *do* represent large groups:
	- **Moral incentives**: personal satisfaction
	- **selective incentives**: benefits related to membership to fund an interest group (e.g. AAA)
# Contemporary Interest Groups
- Huge number of interest groups and lobbyists
	- Often get funding for sympathetic doners and outside resources
	- Some do get only from internal membership dues and small donations esp. enviornmental lobbies
### Why have interest groups proliferated?
- The "social ferment" caused by civil rights inspired social change groups
	- Growing Social Movements: aggregates of people sharing general values and a desire for social change
- Growth of affluent middle class
- Growth of the internet
- Successful groups inspire opponents and imitators
- Federal government encouraging them: nonprofit status, public good without them intervening as hard, special postal rates, etc
- Interest groups rise in defense of government programs, AFTER they have been established
### Fragmentation and Specialization
- New orgs form on new goals, ++fragmented policy forces specialization++
	- Must show their sponsors that continued investment is worthwhile vs other similar focus interest groups
- Coalitions rarely form due to similar ideals threaten the loss of a group's special identity
- **Political action committees**: represent corporations & raise money for influencing candidate selection/wins
# What do interest groups do?
- Survival: must keep org in business and retain members
- Explain government to patrons to create consensus
### Insider Tactics: trafficking in information and cultiavting access
- Mutually beneficial exchanges: lobbyists gain access to elected officials, then provide information
	- Lobbyists attempt to frame policies to show how it will be supported by consitutents
- Lobbyists must have credibility of info or be ousted
	- Often use scientitsts of scholars to testify
	- grassroots lobbying messages
- Lobbyists can make things "cheaper" to encourage a politican to do that thing
	- Doing the work for them
- Lobbyists also support bureaucracy when deciding what to put in the Federal Register
	- Mutual benefits to prevent policies from being removed by Congress or courts
	- Help with budges
### Outsider Tactics: Altering the Politican Forces
- **Outsider tactics**: real pressure rather than reciprocally helpful relationships
- One tactic: mass media to shape public opinion
- Demonstrations/ civil disobedience
- **grassroots lobbying**: mobilizing members to send messages to representatives
- Outside tactics impose real pressure/threats, so politicans don't like them 
### Litigation
- challenge hostile laws or regulations
	- esp. when constitutional rights are involved
	- Often requires a win in the first place in legislation before able to litigate
- Amicus curiae briefs
- Seek to influence court on judicial appointments
### Interest Groups and Elections
- Groups occasionally (usually partisan of ideological orgs) try to replace those in power
	- Usually monitor and publicize voting records of officials
- Mostly through Politican Action Committees (PACs)
	- creation of Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971: form PACs by clearifyling legal status
	- Specify when they can legitimately spend money
	- Put spending on the public record
	- To be **multicandidate committee**: must raise and spend from many people, and as such, can get more money than normal
- Growth of PACs:
	- Grew quickly but stablizied around 4k
	- Contributions increased heavily in 1974-86
- PACs apply to diverse orgs
	- Some are mailing lists, some are huge corp reps or labor unions
	- Usually support incumbent who look to be reelected
- Some PACS conduct independent campaigns
	- Must NOT coordiate with candidate's campaign
	- No limit in spending, but must be reported
- **Super PACs**: PAC funded by corporation's large treasuries and has power
### Pac Influence:
- One view: PAC corrupt the entire process by introducing money instead of constitutents
- Another: PAC officials counter they help elect legislators who already would have been elected anyway
- PAC contributions drive by party, ideology, and state/district interests
	- Exert only modest effect on decisions
- PACs DO have influence
- Barries:
	- Conflict means members get PAC money no matter the side
	- Point of campaigns are to win, not raise money
- Congress can influence PACs more than PAC influence congress:
	- PAC activites are larelgy defensive, cannot lose access
	- PACs are **not** lobbying orgs necessarily
# Interest Group Politics: Controversial and Thriving
- Recent example: covid-19 shutdown and relief benefits caused lobbying to get billions in dollars in spending or tax cuts
- Rise of public interest groups broke up iron triangles
- Fragmentation undermines old accomodations
- Class bias still exists
- **Policy gridlock**: competing groups after iron triangles dissolved

# Research Paper
- ideological conformity encourages decision to fun for office, and polarization discourages moderates from running
- Research shoes that polarization is occuring, but not why
	- Existing: electorate ideological shifts or increased party homogenity in Congress
- Uses survey data of state legislators and ideology estimates combined with who then ran for congress
	- Since state legislative is a spring board to Congress
	- Found that known factors like party recruitment, experience, and support influence chance of them taking office, but also ideological congruence with their parties - liberal Republicans less likely than conservative due to makeup of the party, but not so much on Democrat side
