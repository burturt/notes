Federalism:

- Hybrid arrangement that mixes elements of a confederation, in which lower-level governments possess primary authority, and unitary government, in which the national government monopolizes constitutional authority.
- Federal system satisfies:
    - The same people and territory are included in both levels of government
    - The nation's constitution protects units at each level of government from encroachment by the other units
        - This is why the articles of confederation failed
    - Each unit is in a position to exert some leverage over the other(s)
- Note: Local governments (counties, cities, special districts, water boards, port authorities) are NOT part of the federal system, as the state holds the authority to change them at any time
    - ex. state stopping $8 toll to enter Manhattan during rush hours
- Dual federalism: each level has their own exclusive domains to regulate without interference over others, e.g. coin money at fed, run elections at state
- Shared federalism: authority is shared in domains, e.g. Taxes
- Evolution:
    - Orig. more dual federalism with states exercising national authority
    - Soon after civil war, nationalization shifted some state authority to the national side as well
    - Now, national government has a hand in almost all politics that concern the lives of citizens, e.g. New Deal policies and Great Society and No Child Left Behind Act
    - Why? Many problems cross state borders, like unemployment, inflation, crime, drugs, banking lenders, natural disasters, internet, oil slick spills

### Federalism and the Constitution

- Transformation of the Senate:
    - Equal rep of states gave Senate to defend against national encroachment
    - 17th amendment made popular election of Senators = removed senators' ties to state legislatures
- Constitutional Provisions Governing Federalism
    - National gov has control over integrity of states and national government
    - State protections: once admitted, cannot be destroyed w/o consent
    - Supremacy clause: orig. to allow national presiding over matters both state/national have correct auth to monitor
        - Over time, used to carve out new authority that nat. gov was supreme
    - Congress: elastic clause
        - Gives permission to Congress to make any and all laws for unforeseen circumstances
        - Article I, Section 8
    - 10th amendment: federalism endorsement: powers not delegated to nat. gov are for states
        - Did little because of elastic clause and supremacy clause
- Interpreting the Constitution's Provisions
    - 1816 national bank created --> Maryland taxed heavily to reduce power
        - *McCulloch v Maryland*: Chief Justice John Marshall declared interstate commerce --> elastic clause gave authority, "power to tax is power to destroy", so fed gov exempt from state taxes
        - Gibbons v Ogden: only Congress had authority to regulate interstate commerce in a river shared by states
    - National government slowly nationalized, usually happening over pressure for interstate issues

### Paths to Nationalization

- ex. states tried to prevent railroad rate discrimination --> failed, 1887 Interstate Commerce Act. Others: food safety, antimonopoly laws
- Why nationalization? Collective Action:
    - collcetively decided to adopt policies so large only national government could do it
    - States get national gov to intervene when states alone can't resolve (e.g. national disaster costs in 1906 earthquake)
    - Lobbying nat. easier and more effective than 50 states
        - Civil rights, businesses, etc
- Large transfers of Policy to nat gov
    - President Roosevelt New Deal
        - Economic regulations and relief
        - Established economic management as nat gov responsibility
        - Regulation and financing state action
        - History:
            - Great Depression, states suffering
            - nat gov offer to fund 90% of cost for relief, all states signed up
    - President Johnson Great Society
        - War on Poverty
        - state-run programs funded by nat gov grants
            - e.g. Medicaid, school funding, teacher training, urban renewal, public housing
            - Strings attached: must follow guidelines on how funding spent
                - Forces states to accept federal policy like No Child Left Behind and Common Core
- Nationalization - solution to states's Collective Dilemmas:
    - Coordination Problems:
        - Unstandardized drivers licenses w/o centralized records --> Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act standardized licenses for interstate truckers
        - Energy and power grids
    - Reneging and Shrinking
        - Early years: states agreed to action but failed to honor commitments
            - Solution: fed gov can take direct action
            - Avoids tragedy of the commons (polluted air, etc)
        - Example: climate change
            - Crosses state boarders
            - environmental damage represents an **externality**, effect felt by more people than just the one who chose to cause it
                - ex CA and other states passed laws, fed government eventually passed own regulation
    - Cutthroat Competition
        - Arts: allowed competition between states, giving foreign govs power to exploit competition, states losing
            - Prisoners Dilemma: states could negotiate, but also could "Defect" for a better deal
            - Caused advocation for national government controlling foreign trade
        - Prevent bidding wars:
            - Minimum wage laws (higher wages = less business)
            - Environmental regulation (lax regulation to grow economy)
            - States bidding payments to companies to move in
        - States incentives to go race to the bottom in social services to prevent "welfare magnet" from other states
        - ex COVID supplies
    - Political Logic of Nationalization
        - Ban at national level instead of 50 states
            - e.g. drunk driving law taken to national level by using funding
        - airlines "bait and switch" bypass state complaints by lobbying federal agency
        - Force policy in area where it would be unpopular
            - e.g. civil rights in south in 1960s
        - Environmental Protections at the expensive of states

### Modern Federalism

- National Government Advantage in the Courts
    - Garcia v San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority
        - applied federal wage-and-hour laws to state and local employees
        - courts in 1980s favored national gov rule
    - Recently more state independence
        - US v Lopez, etc
        - virtual pretenses is a "physical presence" and states can apply taxes in 2018 South Dakota v Wayfair Inc
    - Preemption Legislation
        - Federal Laws that assert national government's prerogative to control public policy
        - Developed: the carrot and the stick method to induce cooperation
            - More stick use due to budget deficiencies
    - Carrot: Federal Grants
        - grants-in-aid recent: allow national government to design specific state programs
            - Common Core "Race to the Top"
        - Block grant: gives exact money to spend for some purpose, more is state funds, less is lost
            - No state incentive to control costs below level of block grant
        - Matching grant
            - gives $1-$4 per $1 state spent in an area
            - Leads to major expansions
            - Medicaid example: spend money to take advantage of federal money
    - The Stick: Unfunded Mandates
        - Until 1960s little stick policies
        - rules used more:
            - Fed gov doesn't cover costs
            - ex All Handicapped Children Act saw school districts cut costs to comply
        - Crosscutting requirements: statutes that apply certain rules and guidelines to a broad array of federally subsidized state programs
            - Prohibit discriminatory employment, punishment of lost of grants and prosecution of state officials
        - Crossover sanctions: stipulations that a state must comply to keep full federal funding for another unrelated program
            - ex tied highway funds to adhearing to drinking age of 21
        - Direct orders
            - Enforced via legal and civil penalties
        - Partial Preemption: joint state and fed program; if state doesn't comply, fed can take over and/or remove federal funding
            - EPA, air pollution policies
    - Results of the stick: politicials appeal to citizen demands without behind held responsible for the costs

### Evolving Federalism: A By-product of National Policy

- 20th centry: mainly federal=-state relation changes
    - New Deal/Great Society
    - Sometimes states invited national control
