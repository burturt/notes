### Congress in the Constitution
- Results of Great Compromise:
	- bicameralism:
		- House popularly chosen; suspecible to rapid opinion changes and keep people in voting
		- Senate resist transient shifts in public mood; voted in my states
			- Act as stable counterweight to the House
		- Rep 25 years, Senate 30 years minimum
		- 2 year terms vs 6 year yerms
		- Both must live in same state as place represented
#### Powers of Congress
- Necessary and proper clause:
	- Elastic Clause, gives congress power to make laws necessary to situation
- Foreign affairs
	- Declare war, raise and finance/raise army/navy
	- Senate Ratifies foreign treaties and confirms appointment of ambassadors
- Senate confirms prez court nominations
- Power balance: Only house can start finance bills
- Congress checks on legislation:
	- President can recommend laws, force congress into session, veto
	- Congress using courts to attack exec branch recently
		- After Watergate, House has office to file lawsuits
#### Electoral System
- Members of Congress and presidents are elected separately
	- others: same vote
- Voted in by plurality
	- Plurality = most votes win, NOT majority
	- some other places have **proportional representation**
	- Legislators are elected from territorial units
		- NOT parties
#### Congressional Districts
- orig 33k to one rep, now set max at 435
- Seats change to adjust for population changes
- Gerrymandering:
	- Each state sets own district boundaries
	- Wesberry v Sanders must have equal populations, Thornburg v Gingles districts may not dilute minority representations nor use race as consideration for drawinglines
	- Gerrymandering uses drawing lines to gain or lose votes
##### Racial Gerrymandering
- Gingles decision used to try to design districts to make racial and ethic minorities the majority
- Eventually court decided not to draw districts to benefit one race
	- ex North Carolina crazy gerrymandered
	- Constant fight of republicans
#### Unequal Representation in the Senate
- Each senators ha different number of people to represent
- Not fair to some
- Progressivism caused change to popular election
	- state selection had been corrupt sometimes
## Congress and Electoral Politics
- Major goal of Congress: stay elected
#### Condidate-Centered vs Party-Centered Electoral Politics
- 1800s party-centered
	- Voted based on party lines
	- Around 1900: changes in loaw
		- Regulating elections
		- Secret ballot
		- Primary elections
		- Encouraged **ticket-splitting** - voting different parties for different offices
- After New Deal worked, parties fractured in change in issues
	- More candidate-centered electoral process emerged
	- Incubants advantage from 1960s-1980s due to not having party natural majority
- Recent return to party line voting:
	- Increased corrlation to preisdential candidates for voting
	- Increased Nationalization: difficult to find common ground between parties
#### National Politics in Congressional Elections
- midterm president party almost always loses seats
	- number lost tied to economy
	- reps tied to party politics - have a stake in party public image as well as president
- House Serving Constituents:
	- members of congress often responsive to constituencies requests
	- **casework**: requests from constituents for information and help in dealing with government
		- Lost social security check, lost veteran benefits, DMV ,etc
- Vulnerable Senators:
	- Senate less incumbent wins
		- More news converage, more knowledge, more competition
		- 6 year terms, 3x more likely to not be reelected
	- Usually associated with controversial issues
- Representation vs Responsibility:
	- Candidate-centered electoral process before 1994 --> more individually responsive rather than collectively responsible
		- Collective Action problems
		- Causes targetting narrow programs for constituents without considering other impacts
			- Because of this causing benefit at home but costs elsewhere, no reason to lose
	- Logrolling is popular:
		- Support each others unrelated projects
		- Issue: minority party accuses logrolling (marjority party) for wastefulness and incompetence
- Example:
	- **earmarks**: individual budget items to benefit own constituents
	- **"Pork barrel" legislation**: money spent from government specifically to benefit own constituents, and cause dubious worth projects to turn u
	- Republicans campaigned against this, but ended up earmarking themselves
## Who serves in Congress?
- Most law or business colelge degree and occupations
	- Very few blue-collar
- High under-representation
	- Women, racial minorities
		- Increase recently with Clarence Thomas sexual assault claims ignored by white-male Congress and Trump's rhetoric/actions
		- Increase also due to lower offices starting to be more diverse, trickling up to Congress
## Basic Problems of Legislative Organization
- Congress had to solve basic problems:
#### Need for information
- Congress needs reliable info to properly regulate/legislate
- Solution: division of labor and specialization
	- Committee and subcommitte systems
	- Congress reps can specialize in certain areas and master it
	- In return, experts get more influence in their specialized areas
#### Coordination Problem
- As country grew larger, harder to divide the increasing workload
- Party leaders take over "Traffic control"
	- Members sacrifice a measure of autonomy in returns for efficient 
#### Resolving Conflicts
- Majorities in both houses MUST agree for bill to pass
- Requires successful politicking: getting differing goaled people to agree to take common course of action
- Even ends consensus, must agree on the means
- Regulation:
	- All remarks are officially addressed to the Speaker of the House
	- Prevent personal confrontations
	- Members delegate building coalitions to party leaders
		- Ready-made coalitions helped resolve some conflicts
		- Cost: Loss of autonomy to the party and authority to leaders
			- Lower Transactional Costs, higher Conformity Costs
#### Collective Action
- All want to be part of an effective legislature
- However: all want to be re-elected or elected to a higher office
	- Indvidiaul goals - tax breaks, special projcets for their constituents, maintaining idealogical purity by rejecting compromise
	- Can lead to downfall of party or congress as a whole
- Avoiding: Committees
	- As lawmaking is centralized in parties, incentievs for specialization have weakened, and not to the collective benefit
#### Transaction Costs:
- No way around transaction costs, as they are literally the price of doing politics
	- Coalition transaction costs (conflicts, compromises, favors) unavoidable
- Alternative costs reduced:
	- fixed rules to automate decisions
	- **seniority rule**: give first choice to marjoty party member who have served longest
		- Avoid competition effort going into getting position
	- Follow precedent: strict adherence to precedent in assigning bills
		- inevitably increases power of some members
		- rules are never politically neutral
#### Time Pressure
- Pressure: one-year close of congress and two-year tenure of each Congress
- Chief source of authority is over raisining and spending money
	- If fail to enact budget, large sections of government shut down
	- Recently harder to enact on schedule due to more complex and larger budgets
- Bills must pass all hurdles within the two-year life of a Congress
	- Otherwise must be re-introduced at next congress

## Organizing Congress
#### The parties
- Decisions in the House and Senate are mostly made by majority vote:
	- Enact bills, set rules, establish procedures, choose leaders, and decide how to organize houses
	- Causes powerful incentive to create strong coalitions to get power
- Political parties only form when it is recognized the benefit in working together
	- Members must concede some power to party leaders
- Development of Congressional Parties
	- First senate started to form:
		- Hamilton's Rederalists vs Jefferson's Republicans (modern day Democrats)
	- when divided, party leadership merged with congressional larders
	- **Speaker of the House** was elected by majority to be leader
		- Could appoint committees, make rules, and manage legislative process on majority party's behalf
	- Speaker of the House
		- Centralized authority peaked uner Thomas Brackett "Czar" Reed
			- 1889-90. 95-96, 97-98
			- Exercised unlimited power of recognition
			- Squashed minorities
			- Worked b/c short career in house and little competition in majority Republican party
		- Revolt
			- Speaker Joseph Cannon offended progressive faction
				- Allied with Democrats; voted to strip power to appoint committees and chairs
				- Increased Transaction costs to reduce confirmity costs
		- In sum, Congress is subject to **Conditional Party Government**, where degree of authority delegated to and exercised by party leaders varies with the extent of election-driven ideological consensus among members
#### Increased Partisanship
- Since 1950s increased "party unity" where party majorities took opposite positions
- More reps vote with party than policies
	- Since 1970s increased polarization
	- Helped unify parties and strengthen party leaders
- Party Organization
	- Majority leader is led by the Speaker of the House
		- Majority leader and the majority whip as chief assistants of Speaker
	- Minority party similar led but no speaker as lead; minority leader is lead
	- Party "whips" head up the whip organization (communication network connecting leaders with other members to solve coordination problems)
	- Rules Committee is instrument of the majority party
	- Party leaders are given permission to avoid free riding:
		- Favors
			- ex. leaders have voice in committee assignments
			- Disloyal will have committee assignments removed
		- Scheduling bill talk time
	- Despite this, elections monitor performance
		- Usually, majority party have structure to do stuff, minority party isn't as pwoerful
- Parties in Senate:
	- Smaller, so not much need to organize
		- Under constitution, Vice President presides in Senate
	- **President pro tempore** presides when Vice is absent
		- Neither position has a true leadership role
	- Power of senate leaders mostly based on individual skills 
	- Generally business is conducted uner **unanimous consent agreement** negotiated
		- More minority party influence
- Other groups:
	- Some ideological, demographics, economic concerns, etc
	- Give better access to info and allies on topics of special concern that a party is not already pursuing
#### The committee Systems
- Committee systems are the second organizational pillar holding Congress's powers
	- Sometimes used to frusterate, but ultimately controlled by majority party
- Evolution:
	- First Congress: everyone was part of committee, who elected temp committee to draft
	- Debate line-by-line, eventually vote
		- Issue: super slow
	- Hose: more permanent committees formed, appointed rather than elected
		- soon appointments became partisan affairs
	- Senate slower to create committees:
		- created **standing committees** - exist between sessions unless explicitly disbanded
		- Seniority selected committee chairs: office awarded to majority-party member
- Types of committees
	- committees:
		- fixed jurisdictions and stable membership
	- committee ranking:
		- money committies first
		- Rules Committee in the house
		- Least desirable: ethics
- Assignments
	- assignments are made by party committtes under control of senior party leaders
	- Incentive to properly assign: correct committee = more work done = best chance to reelect
	- Danger: committee stacked not fairly
	- Subcommittees exist:
		- specialization to help run larger committees
	- **special committees and select committees** are appointed to deal with specific problem and then disband
- Joint Committees
	- Gather info and oversee executive agencies but do not report legislation
	- Across both chambers
	- Permanent
	- **Conference committees** appointed to resolve differences between House and Senate bills
- Committee Power
	- Democratic Caucus 1974: no individual can chair more than one
		- Committee members and caucus assumed control over committee rules, budgets, and subcommittee organizations
		- Steering Committee now controls committee election chair
	- Now more difficult to act collectively but more tools to do so
	- Reverted 1995 to give chairs more control over subcommittees, but now had to report to Speaker, and 3 term limit as Chair
	- in general, republicans maintain term limits with seniority, democrats follow seniority and no term limits
- Jurisdiction
	- Many adjustments made to reduce conflict of jurisdictions
- The Money Committees
	- legislative spending is a two-step process
		- The committee with jurisdiction authorizes expenditures
		- Appropriations Committee Appropriates the money
			- writes a bill setting out sums, often doesn't match authorized amount
	- Some expenditures are **entitlements**, which designate specific classes of people whoa re entitled to a legally defined benefit
		- Social Security
- Budget Reform
	- Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
		- Subjected presidential impoundment authority to congressional control
		- Set up Budget Committee in each chamber to oversee taxing and spending policies
		- procedures and timetables for budget target setting
		- Compel members to vote on explicit levels of taxes, expenditures, and deficits
	- Result:
		- sharp partisan conflict over budget priorities
		- Budget deficits in 1980s-90s
		- Congress majority parties just ignores rules themselves
	- Agreements began in 1998 in economy boom
		- new tax revenue meant no deficit
		- Moved to additional boosts, but slowing economy in 2001
			- Tax cuts by Bush
			- increase of homeland security and Afghanistan wars, deficits returned
			- More tax cuts in depression of 2008
			- Even more constant by Republicans and pandemic
#### Congressional Staff and Support Groups
- Adding staff and research agencies to help
	- Assistants to manage offices, draft bills, policies, press releases, etc
	- Deeply involved in all legislative activities
- Government Accountability Office (GAO)
	- Audits and investigates federal programs and expenditures
		- Waste, fraud, inefficiency finding
- Congressional Reserach Service
	- Access to reseraches for Congress
- Congressional Budget Office
	- provides economic expertise
- Groups allow giving advice without biased interest groups
## Makings Laws
- Much easier to stop bills than to make them
#### Introducing Legislation
- Only members can submit legislation
	- Proposals often start outside, but a member must start process
	- Some carry author name to build support/collective action credit
- "dead on arrival" bills to establish records
#### Assignment to Committee
- Assigned number and referred to a committee(s)
	- Complex may have many committees
	- Speaker makes decision in the House
- Next:
	- most bills die of neglect because nothing happens
		- Bills introduced by favor but won't go anywhere
		- Minority party bills buried to prevent embarrasing votes
		- Just too many to deal with
#### Hearings
- subcommittee may hold hearings for everyone to testify in person or in writing about the issues and proposals
- Committees can investigate almost anything
	- Sometimes used against exec when majority rival party controls House/Senate
- Provide a formal occasion for Congress to monitor administration of the laws and programs
	- Appropriations subcommittees in the House to justify budget
		- Usually reactive rather than proactive when problems occur
#### Reporting a Bill
- If subcommittee decides to act on a bill, it "marks it up" (edits line-by-line)
	- Reports to committee
	- Usually bills delegated to subcommittees for efficiency
- Committee writes reports for bills befoer going to the floor
#### Schedling Debate
- Once committee agrees to report a bill, put on calendar
	- House: noncontroversial bills are put on the Consent Calendar (public bills) or Private Calendar (bills concerning individuals) without debate and passed
		- Suspension of the rules to make it fast
	- House: Controversial are placed on Union Calendar (money) or House Calendar (public bills)
		- committee asks Rules Committee for a rule: resolution that specifics when and how long debate occurs
			- Amendments may be allowed from the floor (open rule), only some amendments (restricted rule), or no amendments (closed rule)
				- Closed rule avoids prisoner's dilemmas with many differing proposal changes
				- Used to control agenda
			- May order amendment application
		- Once rule committee assigns rule, majority vote on floor must agree
	- Discharge petition: bring a bill to the floor without committee approval when signed by a majority of house members
- Senate:
	- No Rules Committee or rules limitation
	- Majority leader can preempt amendments by "filling the amendment tree"
		- Annoys minority party who has tools to obstruct
		- Causes more unanimous consent agreements to arrange orderly consideration of legislation
			- Similar to rules committee, except minority party always has a say
	- Without unanimous consent agreement, no limit on talking or amendments offered
		- **filibuster**: make endless speeches to prevent a vote
		- Requires 3/5th vote to invoke **cloture** which allows max 30 hours before a vote must be taken
		- Filibuster super common
			- As a result, basically 60 senators required to pass any legislation
			- Exception: budget resolution which is protected from filibuster
	- If a single senator doesn't agree, unanimous consent agreement won't pass and nothing will happen
		- Lower conformity costs at higher transaction costs in Senate
#### Debate and Amendment
- House:
	- Debate is split equally between proponents and opponents
		- usually 5 minutes each side
		- Acts as the Committee of the Whole to avoid formal procedures
			- Why? **quorum** (number required to be present to act) is 100 rather than 218 
			- Member chosen by speaker holds the gavel
			- Cannot vote in Committee
	- Debates are for public consumption
		- Rarely are votes changed
		- Justify their votes to others through the media
- Senate:
	- Members free to spend as much time talking
	- Amendments often suggests many
		- Amendments need not be **germane** or relavent
#### The Vote
- Legislation goes through series of votes
	- "killer" amendments may make bill unacceptable to majority
	- Opponents may move to recommit the bill back to committee
	- Members may try to strattle an issue by voting for killer amendments but still voting for the bill
- When to vote?
	- Opinions of constituents and advice of trusted colleagues had strongest influence
	- Often rely on polling and input
	- **explainable vote**: vote defended publicly if challenged
- Most voting depends on how strong:
	- intense minorities often prevail over apathetic majority
	- trusted colleagues to guide voting because one person can't learn baout all votes
		- Also turn to others like constitutents and party leaders
- President:
	- Some persuade members of their party to stick with the team
	- Some cut deals with pivotal members
	- Best deals from party leaders is to make legislative packages that party members are comfortable supporting
- House:
	- unrecorded voice votes may be cast, but at 20 members, a recorded roll-call vote is taken
		- Press button for yea, nay, or present
- Senators:
	- Unrecorded voice cotes, but a recorded roll-call vote is taken if any senator requests it
#### Reconciling Differences
- Once passed, bill sent to other chamber
	- If passed with no changes, sent to White House
	- If changes: either shuffles around until agreement or one house drops their version more common
	- Reconciliation: conference committee
		- Party leaders appoint conference delegation that includes members of both parties
			- Eacj chamber votes as a separate unit
			- Bill is not out of conference until approval of both delegations
				- Usually reconcile differences and add/subtract from legislations
			- Once agreement, priviledged (immediate) vote taken
		- Not many reconciliation conferences anymore due to party warfare
#### To the President
- President can sign, veto, or ignore (automatically becomes law in 10 days)
	- exception: ignore is pocket veto if Congress adjourns
	- Override with 2/3rds vote
	- Veto power forces congress to listen to president
#### Bias Against action
- Far easier to kill bill than to pass one
- Unorthodox Lawmaking:
	- Majority party can find legislative agenda frustrated by the minority party
	- Result: unorthodox processes
		- House: complex special rules to minimize minority's influence
			- Bypass committees
			- Rewriting legislation in conference committee
			- Combining bills to make "take all or get nothing"
			- Resultions instead of formal budget
		- Senate:
			- filibuster, forcing 60 person vot
			- Combat: filling amendment tree
	- Requires heavy use of resources (time, energy, favors)
		- High transaction costs
		- **status quo bias**: only some measures can go unorthodox
			- Legislation that fails can be introduced later
## Evaluating Congress
- Most americans approve of current arrangements
	- usually like own reps and senators
	- usually vote incubents despite negative views of government
- Public disdain of Congress:
	- Low repute of politicians
	- Politics leave no one satisfied
	- Pluralism: not required majority, just most votes
		- Lets apathetic majority take over
		- "special interests" win over general interests
	- Still popular when bipartisan occurs
- 9/11 spike in Congress approvals
	- Most conflict than cooperationrfed
