# The Historical Presidency

- Framers decided against internal faction-generating or institutional executive checks, just with limitations
    - e.g. emergency powers
- Originally: limited to responses in national crises
    - Prez lots of filling positions

## Era of Cabinet Government

- 19th Congress routed admin and policy to department secretary
    - Prez consulted cabinet
    - Cabinet not loyal to prez but since app, usually same beliefs, pursing own benefits
- Modern cabinet lost real political clout

### Parties and Elections

- 19th centry: prez huge goal to win office
    - Control over jobs, and before privacy, party that won prez usually also won Congress
- Prez candidates pulled party trains
    - Most media only during election campaigns, with Congress holding spotlight otherwise
- Prez with little history or faction that is controversial more likely to be successful

# The Modern Presidency

### Modern Presidents as Problem Solvers

- Increased shift from state capitals to federal
- Prez independent due to vote: as such, congress gave broad discretion to administer policy

### Divided Party Control of Government

- **divided government**: pits presidents against a Congress controlled house
    - Orig unified
    - As a result: zero-sum game
        - Each side profits from the other side's loss
- Executive Privilege
    - Constitution does not shield prez from Congress opposition campaigns
    - **executive privilege**:
        - Resisting information demanded by Congress
- Immunity from Prosecution
    - congressional investigations in divided party control look for mistakes in president
        - occ. impeachment, but never removal (yet)
    - Now leveraging civil and criminal charges against president
        - Is this allowed?
            - Congress must have valid legislative reason
- Response: taking power for prez, executive orders

## The President as Commander in Chief and Head of State

### Commander in Chief

- Prez is Commander in Chief of armed forces
    - Often, Prez makes first move and leaves Congress to accept or reject
        - usually forced to accept
- Congress response: **War Powers Act** over Nixon's veto
    - Requires prez to inform Congress 48 hours after committing troops abroad
    - Must end in 60 days unless Congressional approval
        - Never tested in courts

### Head of State

- From onset, Prez took sole power to recognize governments
- Limit: 2/3rds majority of Senate to ratify treaties
    - Bypassed through **executive agreements**: joint declarations on how they agree
    - Note: executive agreements can be easily reversed by next prez

## The president as Chief Executive

- Limited details in Constitution on powers
- In general, left to Congress to figure out powers

### Authority via Delegation

- Originally, Congress and prez same party
    - Congress had high TC, prez not so much
        - As such prez delegated many powers to avoid congress work
    - Too rigid = issues and unadaptable until next Congress session
    - Too lenient = too much power to president
        - This also occurs when legislators agree on goals but disagree on specifics, leaving details to president
            - Avoid blame
- Delegation issues:
    - Congress cannot control presidency, and must be careful when delegating power
    - Too much discretion to prez might find control that was delegated to them lost
- Courts ruled prez have great authority
    - **unitary executive** theory
    - Often Prez use **unitary theory** to accomplish policies Congress wouldn't agree to

### Unilateral Authority

- Sometimes executive members run afoul of prez wishes
    - Prez Control: replacing department or agency executives
    - **executive orders** can be used
    - Recently, **presidential memorandum**: direct specific actions sometimes but also make statements
    - Executive order limitations:
        - NOT laws, and must stay in the delegated powers
        - NOT permanent
    - Response to orders:
        - Congress pass law - not possible due to veto
        - Courts have shown history of scrutinizing executive orders

### Emergency Powers

- Congress over time slowly gave power to prez during emergencies

### Budgeting

- Send to Congress budget in Feb
    - Congress can change and/or completely rewrite, forcing one
- Due to prez administrative duties, generally all prez initiatives are considered by a congressional committee

## The President as Legislator

- Can force Congress into session
- Congress can call prez initiative as Dead on Arrival (DOA), but cannot ignore veto power
- President start with party allies in Congress to start getting legislation in
    - opponents usually oppose prez legislation as could be downfall in vote
- Result sometimes: gridlock

### Veto

- Veto is authority used to limit opposing party in Congress
- Can be used to assert policy preferences
    - Less effective if opposing party: "take it or leave it"
- Sometimes prez impounds funds and doesn't use it instead of vetoing
- In state govs: **line-item veto** exists
- **signing statement**: third approach to express their understanding of purpose of bills
    - Used to limit or modify signed in to law bills
- **veto threat**: threat to remove objectionable provisions from otherwise acceptable legislation
    - Must be credible and convince not bluffing
    - Use public for pressure
- **blame game** is played on veto: is it prez or congress's fault?

### Going Public

- **State of the Union address**: allows president to address their agenda and mold public opinion and agenda
    - example of **going public**: engaging in intensive public relations to promote themselves and policies directly to voters
    - TV going public peaked 60s and 70s as only 3 channels
    - Today: often deliver televised addresses, but minimal viewship
- Now they go through appearances and travel and social media
- Prez start on **honeymoon** goodwill high approval rating at beginning, but quickly declines

### The institutional Presidency

- **detailed staff**: help out prez in correspondance
- **Brownlow report** by FDR's New Deal agencies: exec needs ofg dedicated to helping become modern administrators
    - Later Congress created EOP / **Executive Office of the President** to assist prez
        - This began the **institutional presidency**
        - Houses presidential agencies: the **Office of Management and budget** and the **White House Office** and the **National Security Council**
        - **Congress/OMB largest agency**
            - Recommendations on **enrolled bills** and performs **central clearance** over communications with Congress
        - Grown to hundreds, now around 450 full-time
            - 1/3 are PR, some recruitment
- **Chief of Staff**: specialists performing specific routine tasks replaced appointed prez agents
    - Recruited like regular job
- Most staff come to White4 House lacking experience
    - Often arrive fresh from campaign, trying to go to higher office
        - Burnout and turnover are high

# Presidential Power: Neustadt

## Chapter 3

- The government is setup so that parties don't go against the separation of powers set out for us
    - As such, president's authority and status give great advantage
        - People who deal with him are forced to deal with him until end of term
        - On the other hand, a president depends on who they want to persuade

## Chapter 4

- Reputation
    
    - President must have a reputation to use the advantages being the president has
    - Prez constantly observed by others he must bargin with:
        - super diverse group of constituencies watch him
- ## "Law of anticipated reactions"
    
- "People who govern do what they think they must"
    
    - The president's reputation and power depends on what others around him think they will do
    - Anticipate the prez's ability and will to use bargaining advantages
- Prez's goal: create uncertainty about consequences of ignoring what he wants
    
    - ALSO Prevent them from worrying about president backing out after giging support

## Public Prestige

- Negotiators also need to gauge popularity, which can influence success in negotiations
    - Anticipating reactions from the public
    - Difficult to gauge:
        - Public is divided and has varying degrees of acceptance, influence, knowledge, etc
        - Judged by those in Washington
        - often done by talking to one another, sampling opinions in cities
- People want to keep the US and presidency prestige internationally
- President:
    - Can force his hand in many ways in a positive, proactive manner or can end up being reactive, acting in a negative manner.
