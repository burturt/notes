### Intro
- Bureaucracy: let people be experts in their own fields
	- Many are civil servants and serve the public directly rather than Congress or the presz
		- Political leaders face barriers to controlling bureaucrats
- Bureaucracy is required to put policy into practice
## Development of the Federal Bureaucracy
- Task of creating left to Congress
	- orig mail, custom duties, taxes, prosecution, management
	- Each agency brought in to administer specific problem
#### Modest Beginnings: Dilemma od Delegation
- Congress wary of delegating power to executive branch
- Started with Treasury, Foreign Affairs, Attourney General, and War
	- Washington appointed civil servants respected in their own communities to hopefully avoid selfish/corrupt officials
	- Largeer departments grew and divided into **bureaus**
- Question: are bureaucracies accountable to the prez or Congress?
	- Could prez dismiss without Senate consent despite Senate consent required for appointments?
	- Decided as prez power but Congress usually gave followed recommendations
#### The Federalist Years: A Reliance on Respectability
- Orig secretaries were close
- Issue: workers like mail and taxes could easily be corrupted
	- Tried to choose the "best" people
	- Insentivised following law:
		- Tax collectors gain % of seized goods, req. bonds as collateral to force job working, heavy fines
	- Tenure existed for good behavior: passing on jobs within family
#### Democratization of the Civil Service: the Spoils System
- Andrew Jackson advocated for **rotation in office**: official will serve for a short, fixed period, then move onto something else
	- Democratize the civil service
	- Used by party orgs to reward activists with jobs
	- Known as **spoils system**: practice of winning party giving out gov jobs
- Bureaucracy: a hirearchial structure of authority, dividing labor to specialize on complex tasks with a consistent set of rules to follow, impersonality, a career system, and goals to work towards as collective action
	- aka a machine with interchangeable human parts to faciliate collective action while keeping central control
	- Complex arrangements needed to ensure control created the **red tape** - labyrinthine procedures, paperwork, strict adherence to form
#### Civil Service Reform
- Only after Civil War did jobs actually start becoming merit based
	- President Garfield assassinated by a job seaker angered at losing a chance for a patronage appointment
	- Result: **Pendleton Act**
		- Put 10 percent under merit system but allow exec order to expand, with each future prez expanding just before leaving office 
- Results:
	- Left government short on experience and efficiency
	- 80% by FDR were in merit system
	- Kept officials in touch with citizens
	- Career bureaucrats deveolved own personal interests
		- Rules made it difficult to punish for shirking or incompetence
		- hidden action and information issues exemplified
## An Expanding Government
- *what* the buracracy did changed very little: running the gov
- Generally stayed small until civil war when it grew
	- Grew steeply during New Deal, WWII, war on terrorism
- Common reasons to delegate authority:
	- Handle large tasks
	- Exploit expertise
	- Avoid blame
	- make credible commitments to stable policy
	- Deal with crises demand swift, coordinated action
#### The Cabinet
- Cabinet membesr are heads of agencies
	- No special powers
	- Access *does* allow leg up in competition for budget
	- Cabinet/department status embodies interests during times
#### Noncabinet Agencies
- Clientele Agencies: agencies that serve a particular clientele
-  Independent Executive Agencies
	- Made to avoid bureaucratic layers bewteen prez and agency
- Independent Regulatory Commissions
	- Designed to maintain independence from prez and other executive departments
	- Congress adopted to try to regulate steel, oil, banking industries w/o high political costs
		- Avoid direct responsibilty for unpopular decisions
- Expansion:
	- 1800-1900s: regulation of railroads, trust, and montary system
	- 1930s: in response to Great Depression with banking and labor relations
	- 1960s: federal protection of consumers
- **Federal Register**: all administrative rules implemented with the force of law
- Independent Government Corporations
	- Typically run by CEO and board of directors
	- Acts as company, but Congress can control
	- ex postal service, Amtrak
- Indirect Administration
	- federal spending increased, but workforce barely grew
		- Reason: federal policies are enforced both others: state govs, contractors, grant recipients
			- Delegated tasks = doesn't increase bureacracy
		- Grants provided to non profits, universities, research, "nonfederal institutions"
## Bureaucracy in Action
- Bureaucrats: people who staff the federal agencies
	- In general, they work just as well as those in the private sector despite popular belief
	- More diverse
	- Perform many, *many* tasks
#### Bureaucratic Culture and Autonomy
- **bureaucratic culture**: "persistent, patterned way of thinking about the central tasks of and human relationships within [the] organization"
	- Culture is to the org as personality is to the individual
	- Issue: culture binds org together with high morale and missiong causes seeking political control independence
	- IssueL inhibits cooperation between agencies, with FBI/CIA cooperation difficult
- Sometimes prez attempt to change culture
#### Bureaucrats as Politicians
- Bureaucrats are politicians: resources are scarce and must compete
	- Looking for larger budgets, more subordinates, and greater authority; chance to do some good; preference for stable; career stability
- Bureaucrats' most important relationship: Congress
	- Keep Congress happy
	- Astute bureaucrats carefully design and programs to gain support and help cultiave members of Congress and staff
		- Target specific key members of Congress
			- Let Congress take credit
- Bureaucrats rely on appreciative constitutency to ensure survival
#### Bureaucratic Infighting
- Agencies compete for influence, authority, implementation control, and resources
## Who controls the Bureaucracy?
- Congress accused of abdicating power to prez or out-of-control bureaucracy or clients rather than the people
	- Sometimes served private interests
	- Little attention payed by Congress to what bureaucrats are doing
- Strategies to cope:
	- **Police Patrols**: Congress directly monitor agencies through investigations
	- **Fire alarms**: Congress designs procedures for interest groups or citizens to "raise the alarm" when something goes wrong, and Congress reacts
		- Congress can react, but usually lets highest stake orgs monitor
	- more fire alarms than police partrol as it is passive
#### Methods of Congressional Control
- Congress has total say in manners
- Control methods:
	- **Hearings and investigations**: bureaucrats are called before subcommittees
	- **Mardatory reports**: Congress requires executive agencies to report on programs
	- **Legislative vetos**: Either house of Congress or sometimes committees to veto a policy proposal by an agency
	- **Committee and conference reports**: instruct agencies how Congress expects them to use "discretion". Not legally binding
	- **"Limitation riders"**: forbid agency to spend money attached to appropriation bills
	- **Insepctors general**: independent offices in each agency who audit for congress
	- **Government Accountability Office**: central office that audit programs
    - Time limits
    - Congress can force certain methods of implementation on bureaucrats
    - Congress requires giving public notice in the **Federal Register** for policies to have legal enforcement
		- Public hearings, comments, etc
#### The President and the Bureaucracy
- President is the top of the bureaucratic hirearchy
- Heads of depts and other agnecies is direct subordinates of prez
- Prez has large administrative reposibilities
- Prez appoints heads, Senate approves
- Power of Appointment
	- Prez can appoint more than other execs, but often appointments run worse than career civil servants
		- If appointees fail, prez can be held personally accountable
		- No one can easily remove appointments, but civil servants can more easily
- Senatorial Approval:
	- Rarely senate reject, but often appointments withdrawn after signs of rejection
	- Recess appointments: Constitution allows temp appointments of officials during Senate recess
		- expire at end of next senate session
		- Senate response: pro forma session by shortest session possible every 4 days
	- President also self-selects for competence and diversity in a specific field
#### Mechanism for Presidential Supervision
- Office of Managmenet and Budget oversees agency budget and rulemaking
	- Prez use veto to nudge own policies into budget
	- As such, agencies want to keep White House happy as well
#### The Courts and the Bureaucracy
- Lawsuits occur to ensurce gov is acting according to law
	- Government is treated as a party with no special status
	- **Administrative Procedure Act**: agency dealing with individual cases like a court must act like a court, with counsel, testimony, justification, etc
		- Gave agencies some more autonomy but courts regulated
		- Agencies followed procedure to please courts
#### Iron Triangles, Captured Agencies, and Issue Networks
- **Iron triangles**: alliance between agency staff, members of congress, and organized interest groups
	- When made, they control policy out of sight and with huge control
- **Captured Agencies**: Agency that is controlled by the companies they are supposed to regulate
	- Often end once cost is noticed
	- Congress reformed to avoid capture
- **Issue networks**: sets of politicians, lobbyists, academic and think tank experts, and public interest entrepreneurs that negotiate together
## Bureaucratic Reform: A Hardy Perennial
- Every prez tries to "fix" the federal bureaucracy
	- Really difficult to reform and harder to prune due to logic of red tape
#### The Logic of Red Tape
- Red tape occurs to let principals control and monitor agencts (APA)
	- Rules to ensure fair/equal treatment of citizens to prevent arbitrary behavior
	- Only safe answer for bureaucrats is "I followed the rules" when questioned
	- More power = more efficiency but easier for bureaucrats to go astray
	- Comes from Congress's desire to control bureaucrats
- Agency focuses on hard numbers to measure "success"
#### The Bureaucratic Reward System
- Bureaucrats by nature are cautious as a mistake can cause a fire alarm
	- If alart set off and routine followed, routine and not the person is blamed
	- Merit system rewards conscientious, long-term service, NOT entrepreneurial risk taking
