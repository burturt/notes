## Setting the stage for judicial review
- **Judiciary Act of 1801**
	- Sharply increased number of courts and new judgeships, intended to pack judgeships with Federalists as they were voted out of office
	- Jefferson attempted to stop commissions that were delivered
		- Vowed to repeal the Judiciary Act
		- Question: could Congress abolish judge positions?
- **Suart v Laird**: Congress had the authority to reorganize the judiciary
	- Congress did pass repeal and jefferson signed it
	- However, judges asked supreme court to write a **writ of mandamus** mandating instruction to a government officer to deliver commissions
	- **Marbury v Madison**: Marbury had a right to the commission and the laws give a remedy, but the appropriate remedy is NOT for the supreme court to write as it did not have jursidiction
		- Since Judiciary Act of 1789 that gave writ of mandamus tried to supercede the Constitution, acts of Congress that conflict with the Constitution are void
		- Supreme Court established equal footing with Congress and prez, and judicial review of Congress and prez
## Three Eras of the Court's Judicial Review
#### Nation vs State era (founding to civil war)
- Courts generally favored national authority when conflicting with states rights
- McCulloch v Maryland: National Supremacy
	- Federal bank established, state attempted to tax
	- Marshall "the power to tax involves the power to destroy" - state taxing federal p\gov unconstitutional
		- Agreed the necessary and proper clause allowed fed gov to take powers not explicitly given to them
- Dred Scott v Sandford
	- Taney court
	- Claimed African Aermicans were not citizens and were property, and outlawing slavery infringed on the right to "private property"
		- Discreted the court
		- In the end, civil war reversed the decision
- Post civil war
	- 14th and 15th amendments ratified
	- Court obligated to oreview state laws
#### Regulating the National Economy
- The Primacy of Property Rights
	- Marshall court protected integrit of contracts despite states trying to nullify them
	- Supreme Court generally tried to maintain property rights
		- however, did not stop african american disfranchisement and segregation but protected businesses from regulation, counting corporations as "persons"
- SC not alwas pro business:
	- Consistently when "public interest" was at stake
- **Lochner v New York**: struck down law restricting hours worked yet upheld law limiting workday of female workers
- Courts continued to rule against regulation during great depression
- National Consensus and the Court's About Face:
	- **Court-packing plan**: Roosevelt to revamp judiciary and add 6 justices to the court
		- Negative view
	- Despite this failing, court did start to upheld economic regulation
	- Roosevelt did manage to fill the court
#### The Rise of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
- starts 1940s
- Abandoned challenging Congress's authority to regulate, and focused on individual rights
	- New cases sent
#### A Fourth Era? Return to states's rights
- Congress passed: Civil Rights Act of 1964: barred segregation and discrimination
	- Courts agreed that commerce regulation included this
		- Broadly defined commerce clause gave regulation power to almost everything, even what states used to exlucisvely control
- US v Lopez: struck down legislation as exceeding commerce clause
	- Gun possession in a school zome
- US v Morrison
	- Violence Against Women Act as extending beyond scope of commerse clause since gender motivated crimes were not "economic acitivty"
- Super recent: SC ruled that Congress can't go on partisan fishing expedition without intent, and being prez didn't exempt trump from tax laws
	- Lawsuits against agency policies, and court must determine if the agency policy is invalid due to exceeding authority
	- Sometimes simply decides what the law says: protecting 401(k) and social security from collectors
## The Structure of the Federal Judiciary
- Only SC mentioned in the Constitution
	- Framers let Congress create court systems
	- example: **constitutional courts**: lower level courts that exercise the same power of judicial review as SC
#### Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
- SC --> Court of Appeals --> District Courts
- Highest state court --> Appellate Courts --> State Trial Courts
- Complicated. In general:
	- Federal courts can hear "federal questions" and involving cross-state battles
	- State courts have jurisdiction over federal civil courts unless given *exclusive* jurisdiction
	- defendants can invoke "removal jurisdiction" to transfer from state to federal court
		- Usually, if something can be heard in federal court, it will be held there
	- If violating constitutional rights, can appeal to SC after exhausing all other courrts
#### SC's Delegation
- Federal judiciary:
	- Bottom is 94 **district Courts** with 1-4 courts per state
	- Appeal to one of 13 **courts of appeals** (11 states, 12 for DC, 13 covers specialized federal laws)
	- SC is the final court of appeal
		- Can hear cases appealed from lower court or directly from highest state courts when constituional question is in dispute
			- occasionally when state or ambassador is a party 
- Courts are NOT organized or supervised or hirearchical
	- decentralized
	- SC has little say over lower courts, limiting SC policy's implementation
#### Limits of Internal Control
- Judges have life tenure, and SC cannot remove others
	- Only Congress can remove a judge
- Cases cannot be forced into one court or "given" to another if there's a backlog
- Lower courts can ignore SC ruling. Options:
	- Hear the case again
	- rebuke the lower court judge
	- issue a writ of mandamus
	- Assign case to another court
	- All costly
	- **Can reverse lower-court decisions**
## Judicial Decision-Making
#### Slecting Cases:
- SC can choose which cases to take
- To appeal, write a **writ of certiorari** requesting the court order a lower court to send the records of the trial to the SC
- **Rule of four**: 4 justices need to support hearing a case for the writ to be granted
	- Justices have up to 4 clerks to help filter
		- Heavy inspection to hear case
- Resolving Lower-court disagreements
	- SC looks for cases to resolve ambiguities and conflicting lower-court decisions
- Taking Cues from Others
	- Listens to **amicus curiae** briefs - unrelated parties "testifying" for a certain case
	- **solicitor general**: chief attorney for the US government
		- Files own amicus curiae briefs recommending cases be taken
#### Doctrine: Policymaking by the Court
- **Judicial Doctrine**: court prescribed guidelines for district and appeals judges to apply when trying similar cases
- Asumes two forms: Procedural doctrin and substantive doctrine
- Procedural Doctrine:
	- Guides courts on how they should run
	- **stare decisis**: directls lower courts and SC to follow established precedent in deciding cases
	- Established that judiciary would not rule on moot or hypothetical issues
	- **national injuections**: issue where lower courts are making national requirements and statemenets
		- Forces appeal immediately or to SC
- Substantive Doctrine:
	- Guides judges on which side of a case wins
	- **judicial restraint**: a judge who defers to policies made by elected branches
	- **judicial activism**: judges who change doctrine to conform with their view
#### Deciding Doctrine
- Court votes on cases
- Opinion statements for majority and dissenting opinion
	- Each statement holds heavy weight
	- Sometimes to persuade colleagues to maintain or shift position, the message may be dilluted or blurred
- Dissenting opinion: opinion of the minority vote who lost
- Concurring opinion: opinion that agrees with decision for other reasons or interpretations
- Increased opinion writing over the years:
	- SC more control over docket, choosing more controvercial cases with more party divide
## The Supreme Court's Place in the Separation of Powers
- Federal judiciary lacks resouces to allow it to be a powerful, autonomous policymaker
	- Even judicial review is complex, slow, and not guarenteed
#### Absense of Judicial Enforcement
- Courts can't enforce
	- Andrew Jackson "They made their decision. Now, let them enforce it" when forcing Chrokee Indians off land despite it being declared unconstitutional
	- Weak Brown v Board
#### Constitutional and Statuary Control
- Many checks by prez and Congress to limit SC juridiction
	- Court sizes are controlled by congress, expanding and shrinking judiciary
- Congress can amend the Constitution to bypass ruling
- Result: judiciary can't force a huge deviation from Constituion without triggering a reaction
#### Judicial Recruitment
- **Senatorial courtesy**: presidents take recommendations from own party senators
- **blue splits**: senators write on these to Senate Judiciary Committee to express opinions on a nominee
- Filibuster by Congress to delay nominees
- Over time, all of these options have eroded
- Choosing nominees:
	- Prez develop short list, usually already federal judges
		- Chooses those with same ideology on future cases ruling
		- served on appellate judge panels
		- Private interviews with nominees
- Judicial Ideology
	- Usually enter with an establish preference on issues
	- Court shifting to the right over time
	- Preferences of a judge can shift over time without term limits and reelections
## Does a politicized judiciary alter separation of powers?
- In general, judges are being used to issue national injunctions against policies
