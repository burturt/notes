- Local news: declining of local news
- Growth of nationalization of elections
- What is nationalization?
	- Regular voter:
		- What's happening in my city/state?
		- Policies of the candidates
		- History of candidates
		- Commerce
		- taxes
		- practicality/candidate personality/sanity
	- Nationalist Voter
		- Democrat/Republican parties
		- side factions of national parties
		- Track record of the president of the party
		- Track record of party senators
	- Why is this bad?
		- Not as informed about town/city voting
- Trying to gather information:
	- Issue: different places have different demographic
	- Instead: looks at media markets instead:
		- Some counties have local news that talk about out-of-state news rather than actual local news
		- Map shows percent of DMA population is out-of-state
	- Table 1:
		- larger in-state share of DMA does have a correlation with increased Recall, Evaluate, and naming ideology of governor and senator
	- Measure Nationalization:
		- Split-ticket voting
			- More split-ticket voting means less likely to just pick people from the same political party
	- Table 4: main results
		- Regression table
		- slight correlation between in-state DMA share and split-ticket voting
- What do you think of this research? Do you buy the argument and evidence? Does nationalization of US elections matter?
