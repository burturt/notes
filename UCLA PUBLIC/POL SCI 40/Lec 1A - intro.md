        - States decided
    - Judicial Review
- Why missing?
    
    - More concerned about government of framework that WORKS the FIRST TIME, not rights.
    - Expected it to be changed
    - Wanted to make sure states accepted it
        - e.g. avoided slavery to gain support from all states
    - Starting from scratch - nothing to go off of
    - All of the Framers were white landowning
    - Written quickly - status of US was quickly deteriorating
- Federalist 51 (Madison):
    
    - If men were angels, we wouldn't need government
    - If angels were government, we shouldn't need checks
    - Men are not perfect and selfish - government cannot solely rely on people doing their constitutional duties
    - Human nature necessitates governance, and necessitates checks on that power
    - Human nature should be used to keep power in their office and prevent them from powers that are separate aren't going to combine
    - In practice: Congress and other branches haven't always been good at protecting powers
