Federalism:

- Where we hammer our state-federal relationship
- Unique to America
- Federalism refers to the fact that **government authority is divided between the national and state governments**
- "the federal government" refers to the national government in Washington
- Why do we have Federalism?
    - To protect the interest of the states
    - Believed states that smaller governments can serve their constituants
    - Prevent authoriatarian government/separation of powers
    - Disagreed with British Superior rule
    - Needed something to pass and be ratified by the states
    - First 13, now 50 states
        - 50 state governments, 50 state capitals, 50 governors, 50 state legislators (~90k government organizations that exist in US)
        - Transactional Costs and Conformity Costs issue with many governments
        - Conflicting interests, race to the bottom/tragedy of the commons
- Why is it important to understand?
    - Many people vote by Nature of the times
        - They need to know if it's the state government or federal government fault
    - Many only informed about national scale even though state or local where they are more affected by than DC
    - Important for voters to know how much sway they have on a topic
    - Voting Calculus: $p*B + D - C$

#### Federalist 45

- Says that anti-federalists are too focused on keeping existing rights instead of focused on the powers thatmare necessesary for the federal government to run
    - "Constitutional convention is about creating constitution that protects the people, NOT about taking away state's rights"
    - Anti-federalists are doing the same thing that the British did: thinking too much about the institutions themselves rather than the protections it can offer
- The states will hold power; the times the federal government needs power is during war, and a good federal government will prevent this
- Powers being given to federal government are not new: they were already existing in the articles of confederation or are not controvercial (commerce)
