Congress:

- What are members of congress (MCs) supposed to do according to the constitution?
    - Make good laws (provide for the common defense - safe - and general welfare - be happy and live good lives)
    - Oversee the executive branch
        - War making
        - Passing laws
        - proper execution
    - Represent wishes/interests of constituents
        - President's accountability is not a high due to representing everyone
        - Help out constituents on policy and just one-on-one issues
- Motivations?
    - Help district (funding, policies)
    - Insider trading/Self-interest
        - Using not-yet public information to plan stocks
        - Money from lobby
    - Higher asperations
    - Group-interest
- How to ensure MC pay attention to their constituents rather than self-interest?
    - Choose people of good character
        - Tell about themselves, look around background
    - Strict anti-corruption rules
    - Align personal interests with the interests of their constituents *by forcing them to go before the voters on a regular basis to keep their job*
- The Re-election motive
    - Must get re-elected to further any other goals
    - Must act in ways that will get them re-elected
- Mayhew: Congress; The Electoral Connection:
    - Assume that members of Congress *only* want to be re-elected
    - What other motivations not tied to re-election?
        \- Long term benefits != short term results
        \- Long term benefits more likely to be pursued by someone who is in a stable seat
        \- Long term projects
        \- Get a better-paying job
        \- old/terminal/moving away
        \- Party Standing
        \- Pressure from constituents/party/family
        \- <ins>All of these are really tied to re-election in some way</ins>
    - Does this assumption hold for a district that is safe for one party?
        - Even in party challengers can show up
            **Median Voter Theorem (Downs)**
    - Assume that Idology and issue positions are normally distributed in the population
    - In a winner-take-all system, candidates will try to get one more vote than the other by moving center
    - Goal is the win the "median voter"
- Who is the median voter?
    - What does that look like in a competitive district vs a safe one?
    - In districts,
- Attentive v. Inattentive Publics
    - Attentive Publics: citizens who know about an issue and have firm preferences about how Congress should act
    - Inattentive Publics: have neither firm policy preferences or knowledge of what Congress is doing
    - Takeaway: MC should go for Attentive Publics and campaign for them rather than Inattentive Publics
- So WHEN will a member of Congress pay attention to the "median voter" rather than Attentive Publics?
    - When the inattentive public might notice:
        - Voting on bills with a lot of media attention
        - When voting on symbolic issues
        - When their vote might be difficult to explain
            - Raising Taxes
    - Very competitive elections
    - More well-known/general policies/popular support policies
    - Directly affects voters (economy)
    - Media topics: what's popular/trending
- What about attentive publics? When do they win?
    - Complex votes
    - Not covered media votes
    - Tax and regulatory bills more than spending bills
    - Committee votes
    - Procedural votes (procedures about how House/Senate operates)
    - How hard a member works
- So if legislators are primarily motivated by re-elect, how will MC behave?
    - Expresses Constituency Preferences, not necessarily national preferences
        - Complicate collective action: advocating for own goals
            - "pork": attach provisions to random bills
        - Doesn't consider effects on other area
        - Not effective use of federal funding: huge spending only on one small group
    - Pass legislation that contains particularized benefits
    - Pass legislation that will not impose large, direct costs on constituents
        - Costs are passed onto someone else
        - Huge national deficit/debt
        - Prevent necessary legislation (e.g. social security)
    - Pass legislation that embodies a good "end" even if means are poorly tailored to achieve it
        - e.g. paining green to help climate change
    - Serve inattentive publics/median voter on high profile issues
    - Serve inattentive publics/interest groups on low profile issues
    - Express symbolic policy preferences, not necessarily follow through
        - Make promise but not follow through
        - Cancelling student debt
        - Foreign policy
    - **Not check and/or balance the executive branch**
        - Issue: many, MANY presidents overreach power, but Congress doesn't have a huge incentive to check executive branch
- Balancing the Presidency?
    - Incentives?
        - Prestige in institution for legislating
        - particularized rewards for working on committees
    - Fewer rewards for:
        - Checking to see if laws are faithfully executed
        - Researching to see if policies have desired results
        - Narrowly tailoring laws to avoid giving discretion to the executive branch
- "Regulatory Review"
    - Confers **power of final interpretation** on the president
    - Greater power when more room for interpretation
    - Or when presidents interpret their power to interpret very broadly
- Shared responsibilities:
    - War
    - Congress generally doesn't check
- What has changed?
    - General growth of Presidential prominence
    - Precedents:
        - Each of which established in a particular political movement, but becomes context-less beachhead for expansion of power
    - Korea and Alternative sources of legitimacy (UN, NATO)
    - Military tech and Cold War
    - Secret agencies
    - Congressional abdication of responsibility
- Can/Will congress fight to get this power back?
    - Not really, as long as constituents doesn't put pressure

Journal Article:

- Who gets elected to Congress?
    - Politicians
    - Lawyers
    - College Educated
    - White Men
    - Christians
    - Congress is NOT representative in terms of its makeup
- Research question:
    - Do women perform better than men?
        - Why? is discussed in the analysis/explanation of results
    - What is the theory behind this question? Why do the authors think women will outperform men in congress?
        - Do women perform better because the public is more strict about?
        - Self-selection causing overqualified?
    - What is the challenge studying "better"?
        - approval ratings is not really the same as better
        - Instead, looked at federal spending in their represented area, and removed automatic spending, but looks at transportation, special projects, etc
        - Also looked at number of bills sponsored/cosponsored and their success
    - Table 1:
        - In general, female on average gets 9% more funding for their own district than males
        - 0.9 r^2
    - Alternative Explanations
        - Ideology
        - Congressmen give money to women just to prove they aren't misogynistic
        - Women feel unsafer about their seat
        - Committees they are in
            - Set by political parties: women get better committee assignments
