- Midterm Exan Studying:
    - Slides/Notes from class
    - Readings (focus on the textbook, any journal article questions will be big concepts)
- Historical presidency: What did the framers want?
    - Intentionally designed presidency to allow its occupant to rise to demands for quick and concerted action during times of national crisis
        - respond to Shay's Rebellion
        - Rejected a plural executive
        - Created a focal point for coordinating collective action
    - Domestic and Foreign Affairs
        - Leadership gravitates towards the office during moments of national urgency
            - President best situated to propose a class
- Why not a plural executive?
    - Higher transaction cost to make decisions
    - TIME: takes time to agree
    - How do they check and balance?
    - More accountability: executives can't point at each other, it's just the president at blame
    - Difficult for foreign relations / Foreign Policy
    - Opportunity for collusion/corruption
    - multiple presidents can do multiple things
    - Difficult to vote in X executives beyond just one
        - Starts to sound like a congress
- Federalist 70: Hamilton
    - When 2+ are in a common enterprise, opinions differ
    - You divide the country up into factions
    - People will respect the prez less due to split
    - Deadlock can be fatal to the country
- Most states have a "plural" executive:
    - Governor is the strongest office, but other executive offices are elected not appointed
        - Why does this matter?
            - Avoid appoint people for loyalty or favors instead of merit and competency
            - Each office is accountable for the citizens rather than just the governor
        - Why can states do this?
            - states are smaller, less divide
            - States can fall back onto the federal government, whereas federal government cannot fall back on anyone else
            - States don't have as much power
            - States don't have to deal with Foreign Policy
            - Too many offices in the federal branch
            - Make the exec branch of fed run better
            - States are more direct to citizens vs federal who may not directly affect citizens
- When did presidents become involved in policy?
    - During the republic's first century, presidents assumed a small role, like the Framers expected
    - Only vetoed bills they thought unconstitutional
    - Accomplishments were limited to responses in wars, rebellions, or other national crises, NOT lawmaking
- Why not involved in policy?
    - Most thought it was inappropriate for President to get involved in policy
    - No speech making abilities, no bully pulpit, no social media
    - No campaigns - presidents don't have to promise things to get elected and no one expects policy from them
- Is the president a policy maker?
    - Not in the constitution
    - No vote in committees or in Congress
    - Congress has power over pretty much everything policy related
- How does the President get the policies they want?
    - Designing a program
        - Create idea and propose to public or to Congress
    - Working with Congress
    - Implementation in the Executive branch
        - President has wiggle room in many bills
- Designing a program:
    - Campaigning, promises made
        - Make sure it's something the people want
    - Staff
        - orig tiny, now huge staff team

    - State of the Union address, and recommend measures to Congress

- How does the prez get it?
    - Most presidential initiatives do not become law
    - More prez initiatives become law during unified government
- Power to Veto
    - 2/3rds majority required to override
- When is a veto useful?
    - Using threat to get certain things done in Congress
    - When Congress can't get 2/3 majority
    - When Congress is in the opposition
- president's legislative power is the VETO
    - Only useful sometimes
    - If Congress wants to pass a bill and wants the president to sign it, he can threaten a veto in order to exact legislative concessions
    - Can't really use veto power to make Congress consider anything new
- What affects the president's ability to get congress to do what he wants?
    - Who has the majority

        - "At the margins": only matters if the party balance is already in your favor
- Neustadt on President Power
    - "Constitutional Presidency is like a clerkship"
        - Clerk: does the deskwork, administrative work
    - Presidential power comes from position:
        - Professional Reputation
            - What do "Washingtonians" think of the prez?
            - Mutual Trust
            - prestige of the office itself
            - Predictability
        - Persuasion
            - Need actually good ideas
            - Most powerful of the 3 powers because it is the **only** way for the constitutional presidency to get big policies done
            - Be able to convince congress to listen to you
        - Public Prestige
            - Image of the office in the public eye
            - popularity
    - Most presidential power comes from solving or bypassing gridlock
- Unitary Executive Theory
    - Unitary executive theory is a theory of US constitutional law which holds that the President of the US possess the power to control the entire executive branch
    - How could this be beneficial?
        - Decide things faster
        - Executive branch directly accountable to president, who is accountable to the people
        - Easier to hold one person accountable instead of pointing fingers
        - More efficient/less administrative costs
    - How can it be problematic?
        - Own executive agency could fire those investigating the president
        - No internal checks and balances
        - Leave problems to the agencies
- Constitution's statements:
    - Prez has Appointment power for a lot of positions
        - MUST have advice and consent of the Senate
        - Courts defended prez power to fire people at will
    - Take Care Clause and Receiving Ambassadors:
        - Prez has discretion on law execution, 
        - Anti: prez must COMMISSION officers to do it, not do it themself
        - President receives ambassadors themself
    - Vesting Clause
        - All Executive power should be directly put into the President
    - Congress vesting clause
        - "herein granted" powers shall be vested - in contrast to executive vesting clause
            - Does this matter?
                - Hamilton think it does!
                - Executive power does exist separately from stated in Constitution
- Helvidius - Pacificus (pseudonyms used) Debate on Neutrality Proclamation
    - Hamilton vs Madison debate
    - Washington: we should not be get into war, and as such, issues a neutrality proclamation for war between France and Britain
        - Does prez have ability to declare neutrality proclamation? If so, what exactly is that?
        - Can private citizens bypass
    - Hamilton:
        - argues that executive power is vested in prez, except when otherwise noticed:
            - Senate approval for appointments
            - Treaty making
            - Congress power to declare war
        - Proclamation of neutrality is just an executive order, up to executive branch to follow and not cause a war
            - Not a treaty or declaring war, so it's a grey area and has the power
        - President has this power, no exceptions
    - Madison
        - Definition of executive power does not include war treaty
            - treaty is not executing laws, etc, only that it can be made into law and be executed as such
            - neutrality treaty is not an executive power since you aren't executing a law 
                - There has to be a law for the president to execute it
    - Courts decided with Madison
        - Congress then passed own neutrality proclamation
- Spoils System and Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act:
    - Since 1820s, executive branch was largely dictated by spoils system
        - Giving offices as favors/political appointees rather than merit
        - Career bureaucrats would do better
    - Obvious problems ensued; increased as federal government grows
    - Civil service created, greatly limited number of political appointees
        - Lower level jobs are protected by civil service, increase competency of the lower bureaucracy
- Constitution doesn't make it clear: can president fire appointments at will?
    - Congress could appoint, but they won't be good
    - Cabinet could check, but if prez can appoint, not a very strong check
    - If cabinet are trying to undermine the prez, not efficient, so Cabinet
