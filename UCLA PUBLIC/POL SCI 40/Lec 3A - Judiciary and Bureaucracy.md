    - Look at what the judge did in the trial court
        - Is what the judge do violate state or federal law or the constitution?
        - Verifying procedures were followed and ensuring equal chance
    - Role: checking that the judge did their job correctly
- How do judges get their jobs?
    - All appointed by prez and confirmed by the Senate
        - States usually mirror: gov appoints, confirmed by legislator
        - Some judges are elected, usually lowest courts
    - Serve for life
    - Can be removed for high crimes & misdemeanors
- Where does judicial power come from?
    - Vesting clause
        - does NOT have a herein granted
    - Congress can setup lower courts
        - Congress has full say over not SC
    - Judicial powers extend to all cases
    - Question: how many justices?
- Marbury v Madison
    - MIDTERM
    - Marbury appointed to position by Prez John Adams
        - John Adams made many appointments, but the commission for Marbury ended up not delivered in time
            - Prez jefferson told Madison to not deliver the commission
            - Congress and Prez antifederalists, court by Federalists
                - Marshall, Chief Justice, does not want to super anger them and lose court legitimacy
    - Marbury sues Madison
    - Did marbury have a right to his commission?
        - Once it was signed, YES
    - If marbury had a right to his commission, was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?
        - Yes, there is some violation, so therefore there is a remedy
    - If such remedy exists, could the SC legally issue it?
        - NO:
        - SC original jurisdiction:
            - if state is a party
            - Foreigners representing another country
        - Otherwise, it will ONLY be an appeal court
        - Marshall says Judiciary act of 1789 says SC can write writ of mandamus, therefore it is void and unconstitutional
    - Marshall also took the power of judicial review for SC
    - Court order: writ of mandamus
- Federalist 78:
    - SC doesn't have more power over the legislator, but the people have control via the constitution and the court enforces the constitution and therefore protect people's rights
    - Judiciary is the least dangerous since they can't create, and only interpret things from the constitution
        - They also have no means to enforce; they rely on the executive branch to enforce
- Is Hamilton right about "least dangerous"?
    - Assumptions:
        - Impartial judges and not politically motivated
        - Constitution is not really much of a limit: has been stretched like crazy but judges
- Dangers of the court:
    - Judges are not elected, and do not face reelection
        - Judges can go against the population since they aren't accountable to anyone
    - Power to interpret is super powerful
    - Corruption
    - Precedent is stuck in the past
    - Hard for lower courts to make decisions if SC is constantly changing
    - Public opinion changes a lot, and following nature of the times is not good
    - Element of randomness to judges
    - RBG: refused to retire
- Should the ideological make up of the court reflect the will of voters? How to make more responsive?
    - Can't vote on appointments even indirectly
    - Could do direct appointment
    - Term limits
    - Limit Gerrymandering
    - problem: no real clear answer to fix it

## Bureaucracy

- also unelected like the judiciary: appointed by prez or hired like normal
- What is the federal bureaucracy?
    - Large org composed of appointed officials whose authority is divided among several managers
    - Bureaucratic departments make up the executive branch
    - Executive Departments execute laws
- Congress created the bureaucracy
    - State, Treasury, War first
- Inside Departments are Agencies
    - e.g. secret service, coast card, ICE, TSA
- How do Bureaucrats make policy?
    - Congress tell them to through their establishing act/bill!
        - Tells a secretary that they can make decisions
    - Executive departments need more specific instructions
        - For employees and private entities
    - So bureaucrats issue states of policies and **regulations**
- Leadership of the Executive branch
    - Request funds from Congress
    - Spend with any discretion the law allows
    - Appointments of dept heads
    - Appoint other upper level manager
    - Control content of regulations
        - regulatory review
        - More partisan political appointees in policymaking positions
        - Congress has Veto power over regulations
    - Issue Executive Orders to people who work in exec branch about how to interpret and execute the law
    - prosecutorial discretion in implementing of law
		- Deferred action for childhoold arrivals, asylum seekers
- Many laws can be implemented without partisan interpretations, but will they?
	- Issue: partisan interpretation changes every 4-8 years due to flip flopping
	- hard for companies and individuals to keep up with constantly changing laws
- How should we maintain democratic control over law enforcement and the bureaucracy?
	- Give Congress insentive to make more robust laws with less discretion
	- Force transparency, but people may not already care
	- More civil service exams
	- APA: passing laws be a public project, informed citizens can voice up
- One answer:
	- Be isolated from democratic control!
	- Independent agencies and regulatory commissions:
		- Peace Corps
		- Federal Reserve Board
		- National Transportation Safety Board
		- Nuclear Regulatory Commission
	- What makes them isulated?
		- Not appointed by partisan presidents
		- Remain impartial to interpretation, shouldn't vary by political party
		- Not stuff that should involve the party process
		- Issue: experts in independent agency could actually not be competent
			- No people's check, only Congress
- Iron Triangle:
	- Agencies, individual members of Congress, and special interest groups
	- Why do they work together?
		- Each member of Congress has an agenda, so each act differently
			- Each member may have special connections or seats in committees able to exert influence
		- NO people in the iron triangle
	- What issues are they able to exert influence?
		- Funding
		- Amount of discretion an agency can get
		- Interest groups that are affected make more noise
		- Focus on nano-interests that concern only those interest groups and agencies
		- People go back and forth between agencies and private companies
			- Private interest groups and agencies may have huge ties
			- Revolving Door
- How much autonomy from the president and Congress should the Bureaucracy have? What are the dangers of too much/too little
	- Experts will do better than elected members
	- HOWEVER, no accountability causes issues
	- Too much autonomy can be an issue
