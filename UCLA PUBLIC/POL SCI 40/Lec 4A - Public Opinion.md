- What is public opinion?
    - "Opinions held by private persons which government find it prudent to heed."
    - "an aggregate of the individual views, attitudes, and beliefs about a particular topic, expressed by a significant proportion of a community"
- Why do we take public opinion polls?
    - To understand the mood and views of the country on major issues
        - Direct asking people to know instead of guessing
    - Because we don't have direct democracy!
        - If direct democracy exists, votes aren't on the record
    - Two party System (how many options do you have in an election? usually ~2)
        - Not many options: more likely than not, neither will match perfectly
- Example: Switzerland has direct democracy
    - Not possible in US:
        - Significantly more diverse
        - More homogenous populations and opinions compare to the US
        - voters aren't necessarily the most intelligent
            - Alternative: smaller vote = more possible alternate priorities
            - Special interests dominating Congress
- How do we take a public opinion poll?
    - Good Sample size: selection of a group of people that ACCURATELY represents a larger group of people/population
    - Questions that are relevant to what you are trying to figure out
        - Framing it well (causing biased answers)
    - Platform (phone calls?)
        - Response bias
        - Focus groups: since people are paid to go in, they already have a large group
            - Limit: money not much for rich
        - In-person/setup
            - Setup at the polls
    - Working with media (ads on TV)
    - Minimizing bias in questions, polling, population polled, etc
    - Need a population: usually the population are residents of a municipality
        - Sometimes we might want to get more specific (racial and ethnic group, gender, sexual orientation, partisanship)
        - Voters v. non-voters: get general opinion or just opinion of voters
            - Not everyone knows if they'll vote at midterms/allowed to vote
            - People's decision to vote is not fixed
    - We need a random sample:
        - Equal chance for everyone in a population to be picked
        - $120
        - Send a person to the address (who? when?)
    - Do it quickly: over too long, people's opinions have changed
    - Non-compliance: disguising questions (conversation instead of "answering opinion poll")
    - What are we going to ask?
        - What factors to consider when asking questions, and what could mess with our result?
            - order of asking questions
            - answer options (1-5 or y/n or agree/disagree)
            - Misinterpretation
            - Giving context to frame problem
            - social/historical context
- Margin of error:
    - Avoid large/overlapping margin of errors
    - Margin of error = $z * \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
    - $\sigma$ = standard deviation, z determined from confience interval, n = sample size
- Can we ever really be sure of public opinion?
    - What is the issue? How long has it been talked about?
- Philip Converse 1964: The Nature of Belief System in Mass Publics
    - talked to a bunch of people door-to-door
    - Ideologues: people who rely on abstract ideas to measure policies
    - Near-ideologues: trying to do the same thing but looser idea of the abstract idea
    - Group Interest people: conflict between working people vs upper class, do not have a strict idea of what they want
    - Nature of the Times: retrospective voting: "what happened while someone is in office?"
        - Issue: blaming someone who doesn't have control
    - Single issue voters: only a single policy that ties them to a party
    - Dumb Dumbs: no policy significance
    - Actual distribution (1956): 2.5, 9, 42, 24, 22.5
        - Voters: 3.5, 12, 45, 22, 17.5
        - order: Ideologues, near-ideologues, group interest, nature of the times, no issue content
    - Change to now?
        - More people group interest
        - Increase in social media = less no issue content
- 2016: why were polls off?
    - Incentive to lie: didn't want to admit voting for trump
    - People actually voting vs people responding: people thought that Hillary would win anyway
        - Assumption of Victory
    - Immediately before voting, things happened (and after polling)
    - Democrats more likely to answer polls
    - Gerrymandering
    - Voter enthusiasm
    - Political Charisma: targeting audience
- Polarization yet people aren't ideological? How does that work?
    - Median Voter Theorem
    - Parties can find themselves shifting towards a party extreme
        - party sorting
        - Southern Realignment
        - Sense of Loyalty
        - More information/experience
        - Opinion Leader framing: politicians introduce new arguments
    - The electorate hasn't changed much, but primary electorates have!
    - Party Sorting has increased too
    - Choosing a nomination:
        - Who's going to increase voter turnout?
        - Who's going to get swing voters to vote for them?
- Where does public opinion come from?
    - Attitudes ("environment should be more green")
    - Ideology (liberal-conservative spectrum)
    - Partisanship (Democrat/Republican)
    - Family, Social Circle
    - Elite cues (X said Y on social media/debate)
    - When politics may directly affect you (taxes)
- How responsive should the government be to public opinion?
    - Very responsive
    - Challenge: what they want can change very quickly
        - ex Vietnam War, Iraq War
