- Every 2 years: House is up for election
- Every 6 years: 1/3 senate in power
- Constitution Senate:
	- Up for election each 6 years
	- Originally selected by state legislators, 17th changed to direct
	- 2 per state
- House constitution rules:
	- every 2 years
	- selected by largest house of state legislatore (popular vote)
	- number of districts based on populatuion, not set
	- Another rule not in constitution: elected from single-member district
- Senate seats are fixed, but the house is not!
	- reapportionment: Census causes number of districts to change
	- Redistricting: changing the boundaries of district after census
		- Issue: redistricting is subject to human self-interest, causing gerrymandering/red lining (planning city to split rich/poor)
		- Most states have legislators draw districts 
		- Some do non-partisan commissions
		- some hybrid
		- Issue: Legislators are picking their voters when it should be the other way
		- Issue: Impossible to draw a "non-gerrymandered" map: it's a sliding scale
		- Issue: Nowadays, very few seats are party contested due to gerrymandering "locking" in seats
- Issue with gerrymandering:
	- Primaries have no concept of locked in seats
	- Very limited choice between parties in most districts
- States get to decide!
	- Only requirement: continuity of border, equal population, feet Voting Rights Act
	- Can choose:
		- Compactness
		- Keeping together communities of interest
		- Partisan gerrymadnering
		- Incumbent protection: forcing incumbent out
		- Maximizing Competition
- Europe:
	- Vote for political party you want to govern
	- Coalition government: parties group together to run the government
- Pro/Con for single-member districts:
	- Pro:
		- More clear who is your representative
			- Personal connection
		- Not direct party control (you aren't voting for a public)
		- Personality, charisma, and personal qualities of candidates becomes more important
		- Execute does not serve at the pleasure of parliament, cannot be easily bypass
		- Individual elections are simpler
	- Con:
		- Discourages voting
		- Not representative of the population
		- Prevents 3rd party from running
			- Risks hurting the party of the closest ideologies
			- ex green party takes away votes from the democrats
		- Primary elections become the main mdoe of candidate selections
		- Overall elections are simpler in parliamentary systems
		- Whole country does NOT have the say in parliamentary elections
		- Candidates and parties devote more time and money capaigning in certain district and not others in single-member systems
- Hisotry:
	- Originally, nominations done in closed door meetings
		- No primaries
		- Parties wanted a candidate to win the general election, not necessarily a candidate that the people were enthusiastic
		- Generals ran for office
	- Reforms after 1968 Democratic convention convinced both parties to open the process up
- Two stage process:
	- Political Parties nominate presidential candidates AT NATIONAL PARTY CONVENIONS in August of presidential election years
	- Ultimatey, the nominees will be chosen by convention delegates, most bound by primary votes
		- Superdelegates used to exist Democrats: party leaders got a vote, but only exists if first vote doesn't cause a win
	- Each party nominates a candidate for president at a national party convention
	- only DELEAGTES cast a binding vote
	- Nominee is the candidate who gets a majority vote
- Who decides the nomination rules?
	- State parties make delegate selection rules
		- Also schedule date of primary
			- Why does this matter/why fight?
			- Iowa got first primary, but because they are first, they get more attention because of going first and seeing which candidates are leading
				- Candidates may have already dropped out
			- Bandwagon effect (voters, donors, media)
			- Later primaries, the race is often OVER but not always (2008)
- How are delegates chosen?
	- Presidential primary
		- State-sponsored election to select delegates to national nominating convention
		- Votes determine delegates each candidate gets
	- State party convention
		- A closed meeting of selected state party members 
		- Pre 1968 mostly
	- Caucus
		- Series of public meetings of local party groups where oridanry voters express prefereces for each presidential candidates
	- Republicans vary by state
	- Democrats use one rule: porportional allocation to candidate if you get at least 15% of the vote
		- Leads to a longer primary season since primaries don't end quickly/hit win threshold
- Primaries:
	- Closed: only registered party members can vote
	- Modified: mostly open with caveats
	- Open: anyone can vote, but can only vote in one primary
- How often do complicated rules affect the outcome?
	- Not often!
	- Usually clear pretty quickly
		- Demoncrats usually are closer races
- The invisible primary: who *actually* wins the nomination?
	- Campaigning starts years before elections - this is the invisible primary
	- The "best" representaitve of the party
		- Party made of voters, interest groups, elites with a stake in the party, and decide who to support
		- usually happens with funding, endorsements, and media coverage
	- The party begins conversations during invidiuble primary
		- Year before voting behins
	- Usually, the candidate with the most support during the invisible primary wins
		- NOTE: funding/endourcement is not the only measure of "winning" the invisible primary
- Electoral College Rules
	- Each states get number of electors equal to Reps + Senators
		- Electors are NOT Reps or Senators themseolves
		- Electors are chosen my parties + campaigns
	- Electors meet in own states
	- Cast 2 votes: one for prez and VP
	- Person with majority of electoral votes becomes presdient
	- If no majority, House of Pres (one vote per state delegation) selects president from among top three Electoral College vote-getters
	- Faithless electors: electors are only bound to vote the same way as their state if the state legislates that
- Pro/Con Electoral College
	- Pro
		- Campaigns must not ignore small states
		- Enables residents
		- Mob mentality: avoids this issue
	- Con
		- Small states overrepresented - bias towards rural areas
		- Discourages vote for most
		- Plurality doesn't always win
		- Candidates focus mostly on swing states
		- Faithless electors
		- Citizen's votes not weighted equally
		- Predetermined votes
- Trust in elections: less confident over time
- How do voters vote for president?
	- Party ID
	- The economy (Nature of the Times)
- How do voters vote for Congress?
	- Name recognition
	- Incumbency
	- Party ID
- Do voters want moderates or extremists in Congress?
	- Voters do NOT want extremists
- What can campaigns do?
	- Help at the margins (close seats)
	- Can frame the issues important in the election (especially in presidential races or scandals)
	- Helps even more in open seat races (no incumbents)
	- Minimal effects hypothesis: Campaigns have little to do with the outcome of the election because:
		- Both sides can campaign (negates other sides)
		- Persuasion is hard, not many swing voters
		- People forget campaign contacts
- How can campaigns be beneficial to democracy?
	- Encourage participation
	- Can be harmful when money gets involved
- Research Papers:
	- Are voters rational?
	- Do voters counsider irrational events when voting?
		- used college football as no rational cause or response by elected
	- Result: found slight increase when voting
- Paper 2:
	- False positive: Methods are good, but really unlucky in that it was random/caused by something else
	- Challenges to show false positive:
		- You only have the same data so can't rerun experiment
		- Instead: "if this result is true, then certain things should be true"
	- Ran tests and found that in fact false positive result
