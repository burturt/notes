- [Lec 5B - Interest Groups and The Media](../../UCLA%20PUBLIC/POL%20SCI%2040/Lec%205B%20-%20Interest%20Groups%20and%20The%20Media.md)Where does the right to create a political party come from?
    - Constitution!
    - First amendment: Congress cannot stop peaceful assembling and petitioning
- What is a political party?
    - A team of people seeking to control government by winning elected office
        - Missing: ideology b/c impossible to define ideology of a political party
- How can political parties be both good and bad?
    - Neutral:
        - easier to participate
    - Good
        - Shortcut to selecting candidate/voting
            - Reduces voters informational costs
        - Limit number of candidates
            - Issue with too many candidates: knowledge, messy elections (prez/Congressional district ends up weirdly represented due to proportional # of candidates with similar ideology)
        - Reduce Transaction Cost of making bills
            - makes legislating easier
        - Parties can educate voters/incentive to educate
            - Mobilize voters
        - Party accountability
            - Regulate politicians' ambition
        - Reduce candidate's costs
        - Enforce collective responsibility
            - Allow voters to make simplified choices and punish elected officials they don't like
    - Bad
        - Nationalization of voters/voting
        - Majority rule: exploiting minority
        - Requires compromise due to conformity
        - Promotes polarization
        - Promotes animosity/hatred
            - Magnify and harden conflicts
        - Oversimplify issues
        - Can seem to relieve citizens of hard work of self-education
        - Election motive can cause party to adopt unsavory characteristics or policies

## Three incarnations of a Political Party

- Party as Organization: tries to win election
    - Candidates
    - Donors, Volunteers, Active supporters
    - Some issue-centered interest groups
- Party in the Electorate: Strong psychological attachments
    - Self-identified Democrats, Republicans, and Independents
- Party in Government: Those who win have agenda control & power over who gets what, when
    - Party caucuses/conferences/Divided & united government
- National Political Parties:
    - DNC and RNC
    - the national political party is NOT "the party"
    - Better to see them as service orgs:
        - *Service candidates with funding, campaign materials, training, education
        - *Oversee the national convention
        - *Create the national platform
            - `*` = also state levels
        - Recruit and train candidates

## What do national and state political parties want?

- Generally to win elections and control government (at both the state and federal level)
- How?
    - Recruit good candidates (electability)
    - Raise money
    - Mobilize party voters
    - Appeal to median voter (expanding party coalition)

## What do candidates and officeholders want?

- To win their OWN election
    - Doesn't care as much about the party itself
- How?
    - Advocate for policies that are important to constituents (median voters)
    - Push the party in a direction that would benefit the candidate/officeholder
    - Serve special interests in low profile issues
        - If not, you could lose marginal voters, funding, party disavow, etc

## What happens when parties and candidates are at odds?

- Nasty primary elections
    - Split voter base cause issues
- attacking incumbent
- Voters start to question what this party actually stands for:
    - Polarization: candidates polarize, party try to center

## When/how do parties change their platforms

- After losing an election!
    - Winning is a winning strategy, don't try to change it
- What do parties have to think about?
    - Why did we lose?
    - Why did the other side win?
    - How can be "capture" some of those voters
    - How can we turnout more voters from our side?
    - What things should the party be talking about to turnout partisans and capture swing voters?
- Of course, national/state parties, candidates, officeholders, interest groups, and activists all have different ideas on how to do this
    - A lot of enthusiasts: attempt to turn non-voting partisans to vote even if losing swing voters
- Example: republican party after Obama
    - Lost "safe" republican states
    - Came out with report ("Growth and Opportunity Project"): must be more inclusive
    - Result: completely ignored b/c Trump pushed party in a different direction (appealed to US nationalism)
- Why aren't others pushing back?
    - It was successful!
    - Avoid having to appeal to new groups of people
    - Dangerous to propose alternative because it could split the party
        - Did not want to risk just to make a statement or ideology
        - Trump with power can simply disavow someone and have your vote lose
    - No other leader to rally behind (Reagan is dead, Bush disliked, McCain and Romney lost)
    - Trump's message resoated with many Republican voters and remains popular
    - Republicans who have opposed Trump have not fared well
- Republican party today:
    \- Winning message in 2016, but not in 2020
    \- Included denying election results, anti-science, and defense of Jan 6th
    \- Message may have cost Republicans the Senate
    - Republicans have some interesting candidates in 2022: can win battleground states?
    - Will the Republican party change again?
        - Depend on electoral success (midterms probably less important)
        - If trump runs again in 2024, what happens if they win/lose?
        - After era of Trump?
            - May moderate slightly due to fraud claims, Trump unique person, demographic change
- Democrats:
    - Internal strugges: 2016/2020 primaries
    - Do they want more moderate or more extreme?
    - Clinton thought she had a winning message and almost did:
        - Election came dowen to 50k votes in 3 states
        - Huge rural white voter turnout
        - Democrat turnout was lower than usual
    - Internally: DNC favor Clinton
        - Probably because Clinton had a better chance of winning but not Sanders, but then she lost
    - In light of Clinton's loss, is Far left better?
    - Democratic primary selected Biden over Sanders
    - Could boost Republican turnout
    - Could also boost Democrat turnout (Clinton/Biden not particularly exciting candidates)
    - Will the democrats change?
        - Probably not as much:
            - lots of popular figures (Clintons, Obama, Pelosi)
            - Less internal strife and nastiness
            - Don't have to pick sides on controversial issues
- Parties want candidates who have high "electability":
    - Experienced officeholder (campaigned before)
    - Name recognition (known in the community)
    - Moderates (Median voter theorem/performs better)
    - No Scandals
        - Can upset "safe seats" occasionally and cause upsets
- Why can it be hard to find good candidates?
    - Costs of running for office are huge
        - last year+, immediately think of re-election
        - Full-time job without pay (have to have money)
        - Campaigning is not fun (begging for donations, calling donors, giving speeches)
        - Devaluing of political office (who likes members of congress?)
    - Who is going to brave those costs?
        - Someone with a strong stake in the outcome, partisans more than moderates

## Thomsen 2014

- Does party fit affect a person's desire to run for office?
    - Party fit: how much the party's ideology matches a candidate
    - Issue: bad party fit means you can't get
