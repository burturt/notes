- Interest group:  group that have organized to promote a political agenda
	- Often work with political parties, but do not run candidates for office explicitly
- Examples:	NRA, Sierra Club, AARP, etc
- Not all views have an interest group:
- When will an interest group form?
	- Free rider problem: one person's contribution to the collective good is small
	- Collective good will be provided regardless of person's contribution
	- people can receive the benefits without contributing
	- Private incentive is to "free ride" on contributions of others
- Who are more likely to face collective action problems?
	- Large potential groups
	- Heterogenous potential groups
	- Groups that demand high costs
	- Groups that rely on intangible benefits
- What can interest groups offer? Why join?
	- Information (voter guides, emails, meetings)
	- Swag (NRA, Sierra Club)
	- The ability to feel like you are part of something without actually doing much
- How do interest groups get their power?
	- "Interet groups/corporations/lobbyists buy votes with campaign donations" - is this actually happening?
	- Investing on friendly candidates
	- Campaign finance is regulated by the federal government:
		- PACs (Political Action Committees)
		- Must raise for 50+ people, contribute to at least 5 candidates
		- Max $5000 contribution per campaign
		- ++All Public info++
	- Is $5000 going to buy a vote? Not really...
	- How do NRA actually get power?
		- Citizens United v. FEC: "independent spending outside of political expenditures cannot be limited"
		- NRA can spend as much as they want as long as they don't give the campaign directly
			- Buy ads, leaflets, etc
			- Independent expenditures: money not given directly to a campaign but still benefits campaigns
			- Issue: money bias, interest groups doesn't represent, buying votes
				- ex. NRA doesn't give any  money to democrats
			- Pros: money would be spent otherwise, reward for already voting in alignment
- Lobbying is not regulated like PACs:
	- Many businesses still spend a lot of money on lobbying
- If an interest group doesn't like you, they can "primary" you or try to kick you out of primaries
	- try to fliip seats
	- Mobilizing voters: tell people to not vote for a group
- Where is the gun control interest group? Why is the NSA so powerful?
	- legacy and identity
	- More directly identify as gun owners than target of gun violence and passionate 
	- Easy to have collective groups
	- Easier to protect existing rights rather than taking away rights: defensive vs offensive
	- Group wealth
# The Media
## History of American Media: Early Newspapers
- Newspapers were explicitly partisan media
	- Low literacy levels: creating news for the elites
	- No campaigns to inform voters
	- party/elite oriented politics, less concerned with average voter or citizen
- Readers were viewed as voters to mobilize and persuade, not citizens to inform
## Rise of Consumerism
- In mid 19th centry, more people moving to cities
	- Urbanization
	- More going on, harder to be informed about everything
	- More people concentrated in one place
- Invention of the penny press
	- Cheap newspapers made in mass quantities
	- More ease of printing came more demand for stores (news orgs had to change to adapt)
- Rise of congressional and party campaigning
	- Don't need newspapers anymore for political communication
- More consumerism/products/companies
	- Advertising becomes a larger source of revenue for news companies
		- More companies bought ads
	- Don't want to limit your audience, so less partisan news
## Radio!
- Early 1900s, radio began
- Radio airwaves are public and limited
	- overlapping = static and useless
	- Congress created FCC to regulate airwaves
	- Creates fairness doctrine (cover issue fairly, present both sides) and equal time rule (give all candidates equal air time)
## Cable
- Private companies lay down cable lines
	- Congress unwilling to regulate cable same way
	- radio can't compete, so congress removes all regulation
- Allows for creation of conservative radio, and then Fox news
	- Only one partisan news outlet enjoys success, many followed
## Why don't Americans like the media?
- "fake news"/unreliable
- Revenue, not education-focused
- titles and articles are sensationalized
- irrelevant news
- Toxic
- Corporations own media
- Partian bias
- opinionated
- Short-exciting segments are highlighted instead of giving all the details
- More focused on entertainment
- Beat journalism - constantly reporting the same topics
- News personalities that people hate
## What do citizens want from the media?
- Assume:
	- People are rational
	- People are self-interested
	- an informed citizenry is a public good
- What is the incentive to free ride?
	- Why pay for news if you'll get it anyway?
- Thinking in more detail:
	- 3 types of people:
		- Value public good and well educated
		- Value public good and are not well educated
			- TARGET for news: easy to deceive to get attention b/c they care but don't know better
		- Don't value public good
	- How much would each group pay in opportunity costs to further inform themselves?
	- What would allow each group to inform themselves at low cost? high cost?
	- Approximately how many of each group are there, and how much demand would they create for each type of news?
	- Given all of this,, what is the demand for news?
		- Self-selection, big headlines nowadays
## Media ownership in the United States
- Concentrated among 6 companies is 90% of all media
	- After profit unlike smaller news organizations
- If the media is owned by corporations, it will also be self-interested
## How do they make money?
- Attract viewers, readers, website hits, listeners, etc.
- Sell advertising time to companies that want to sell stuff to those viewers
- More viewers --> more can be charged for advertising
## What kind of journalism is going to be costly for the news media? What are some cheaper options?
- Polls
- Venues
- Associated Press/recycling stories
- Yellow Journalism: blowing things out of porportion and have bias in order to get a reaction and viewership	
	- Dramatic stories
- Covers things that we already know about
- Scarying stories
- one-sided stories, not dealing with interviewing both perspectives
- Don't fact-check or verify your own perspective
- What happened is cheaper but why is more expensive
	- Jumping to conclusions 
* * *
- Costly: Investigative, Foreign reporting, original reporting
- Alternatives: Opinion, buying stores from wire services, recycling stories
- Attracting more viewers: simple stories, Drama and emotion, Sports/weather/celebrities, and partisan news (people want confirmation, not attacks/contradictions)

## What about bias?
- Bias towards that:
	- Depend on official sources
	- Sensationalized
	- tell a "gamesmanship" story about politics
	- Are biased towards on party/ideology or the other
	- Center white people
	- Center heteronormativity
	- Center the US over other national perspectives
## Is there a liberal bias in traditional news media?
- study found more hate towards Obama than Romney
	- Probably result of being black
- 2016 election: Coverage of Trump more favorable than Clinton
	- Much less favorable of Trump after entering office - almost completely negative or neither compared to other presidents
- Evidence for bias?
	- Unlikely that this is being driven much by bias in either direction
	- More likely driven by profit motive
		- What is more interesting, Trump rally or Clinton speaking, Clinton campaigning or email scandal, Obama's "political talk" or Trump's tweeting and strange behaviors?
- Journalists are more likely to lean Democrat
	- Professional norms still exist
	- Ratings/Profit incentive to sell to as many people as possible
## Partisan Media
- Republicans generally don't trust media with exception to fox news
- Democrats generally trust more
- Steep decline of trust of news for republicans
- Local news still trusted
- Social media still not trusted by anyone
## Why would someone watch partisan media?
- Good guys v Bad guys narrative
- Don't need to analyze, information and analysis already done for you
- Comforting, Entertaining
## Is partisan media a problem?
- Pro: mobilizes voters, people just confirm their votes, not change votes, partisan news exists on both sides
- Con: Echochamber issues, polarization
## Where can bias be evident?
- Story choice
- Placement
- Headlines
- Framing
- Photographs
## Racial Bias
- More likely to report Black suspects than other races
	- More sensationalized titles/pictures, may paint black as worse than they might paint white suspects
- Career Oriented Journalists Bias
## Beat Reporting
- White House Reporter, Pentagon Reporter, Stock market Reporter
- Is there a soup kitchen report? Education reporter?
	- No: leads to overrepresentation of certain topics
## Searching for "scoops"
- Cultivating relationships with people inside the administration (exclusives)
	- Want to be known as the guy who gets the stories first
	- Get promoted/better pay
- If a reporter discovers something unflattering about one of their sources, they may not publish.
## Exposing Scandals
- Want to be exposing a thing that brought a powerful thing down
- Issue: blowing things out of porportion; lies/misinformation; look at bad aspects; only report scandals of people who are not your sources
- Media obsessed with scandal forces knee-jerk reactions
## Flashy, Scary, Controversial, and being "newsworthy"
- What is newsworthy?
	- I covered something because it's "newsworthy"
	- Cop out to report on whatever they want
- Trump's rallies v other Presidents
## Objectivity, Fairness
- Media cannot be truly objective
- media can't be fair to all sides: more than 2 sides 

# Research paper
- Does local news coverage of crime affect police behavior?
- Less coverage may mean police behavior means citizens care less about police, leading to police being lazy.
- If sinclair purchased your news story, chance of covering a crime story is covered decreases by around 2.4%
- Police clear fewer crimes when there is less reporting on those crimes
- Placebo test done on property crimes
- Why does this matter?
- Who is to blame?
